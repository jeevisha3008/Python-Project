       " 'Long stretches of time spent entirely alone? Elaborate stratagems dreamt up to maximise self-sufficiency? Straggly hair in need of some serious salon time? Anyone currently on lockdown or self-isolating will likely be able to relate to these features of a hermit’s life and more. Thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, even with screens permitting all manner of virtual connection, our homes can still feel as isolated as a recluse’s mountaintop eyrie. There’s one crucial difference, of course: unlike most of us, those legends of old chose their solitude. Evolutionary biology tells us that we’re social animals, genetically programmed to build relationships and communities in order to survive and to thrive. Yet throughout history, there is evidence of a counter desire, a largely unsung and often mistrusted need for isolation. Nothing illustrates this better than our enduring fascination with hermits both real and fictional, from poet Emily Dickinson to billionaire Howard Hughes and Dr Seuss’ Grinch. In 18th Century Britain, landowners even built miniature classical temples in which to house men hired to play the part of so-called ornamental hermits. The word itself dates back to the 12th Century, and comes from the Greek word erēmia, meaning desert, a big clue to its religious roots. Paul of Thebes is widely regarded as the first hermit, fleeing anti-Christian persecution and a scheming relative to exist alone in the Egyptian desert from the age of 13 to his death in the year 314, aged 113. He lived in a cave, dining on bread delivered by a raven and dates from a palm in whose leaves he clothed himself. At the end of his life, he was visited by Anthony the Great, a monk who founded the Desert Fathers movement, drawing thousands to austere lives in the spartan landscape. Other religions have their own hermits. Hindu philosophers, Taoist poets, Jewish mystics – all have been known to retreat from society in order to devote themselves more wholly to their faith. There were women, too, among them Mary of Egypt, the patron saint of penitents, who isolated herself in order to atone for her insatiable carnal appetites. On the whole, though, holy women of the 4th and 5th Centuries lived in fledgling monasteries, and there is no escaping the gendered notions inherent in our images of hermits. Look to other cultures, and you’ll find that even early Buddhism’s chaste female wanderers, for example, were exceptions to the rule. Like the Hermit card in Tarot decks, we picture them male. In literature, the woman who opts for isolation tends to be at best a figure of pity, at worst, something more malevolent. Just contrast Charles Dickens’ wretched Miss Havisham or Charlotte Bronte’s original madwoman in the attic with Daniel Defoe’s iconic castaway, Robinson Crusoe. Crusoe didn’t choose solitude, but he has nevertheless become its secular icon. It’s worth noting that he did find faith while stranded on his Caribbean island, ensuring that, heart-breaking laments notwithstanding, he never felt entirely alone. More pertinently to our contemporary plight, he kept himself really busy. You wouldn’t have caught him binge-streaming box sets; instead, he set about building his own home, growing food and taming wild goats. Defoe’s legendary loner also had another advantage: he was written into being before the concept of loneliness as we understand it today took off. Indeed, “loneliness” is a word that rarely appears at all in English before about 1800. That’s in part due to the cramped intergenerational lifestyles that people were forced to lead. Living alone, as so many of us now do, would have been almost unheard of. Not that being alone is synonymous with loneliness. If we confuse the two, it’s probably because we live in a society in which being on your own continues to be used as a punishment, from toddler time-outs to solitary confinement. Yet as anyone who’s ever walked into a sea of unfamiliar faces at a crowded party knows, there is a difference between feeling alone and being alone. Being on your own can in fact be calming and restorative. Even teens, one study has found, are less self-conscious when they’re alone. Time spent with yourself gives you a clearer sense of who you are, and however discontented hermits are with the societies from which they walk, on some deep, peaceable level, they’re quite contented with themselves. As American philosopher Henry David Thoreau confided: “I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude.” Thoreau’s isolation has been greatly overstated. As it turns out, he hosted dinner parties at his pond-side Connecticut retreat and mum did his laundry, but he fuses multiple strands of hermit motivation: holing up for two years, two months and two days was at once a back-to-nature bid, striving for a life of monastic simplicity and also a means of focusing on his work. The creative benefits to be had from time spent alone are ample. Greek philosopher Plato, who’s known as the first poet of solitude, insisted that he needed it to think. Making ‘The Case for Hermits’ in his 1935 essay, English writer GK Chesterton was blunter: “If men do not have Solitude, they go mad,” he declared. Not for nothing did Virginia Woolf fantasise about that room of her own and poet William Wordsworth declare solitude “bliss”. But it’s our own 21st Century era that has seen the most pronounced moves to collectively retreat into our solitary cells. Even before the current pandemic hushed our cities, there was an emerging cultural vogue for celebrating the joy of missing out by simply staying in. Japan has taken this to extremes with a growing population of hikikomori, individuals who withdraw entirely from physical social interaction. Of course, technology now brings the world to our sofas. Thanks to the likes of Deliveroo and Netflix, we have less and less cause to leave our own sanctuaries. This has also meant that the life of even the most committed hermit isn’t what it once was. Consider Mauro Morandi, who’s earnt himself a reputation as Italy’s Robinson Crusoe. The octogenarian remains the sole inhabitant of the island of Budelli, off the coast of Sardinia, where he spends a lot of time reading and thinking and collecting wood. One feature of his routine that’s changed in the 30-plus years he’s been there is Instagram, to which he uploads images for his 47,000 followers. The Greek word erēmia is in turn rooted in erēmos, meaning desolate. While a certain bleak emptiness can accompany unsought solitude, there is solace to be found even so. As Chesterton observed in that same essay of his: “It is in society that men quarrel with their friends; it is in solitude that they forgive them.” Nurture those replenished feelings of goodwill. In today’s terms, maybe pick up the phone and have a chat. Remember, too, that being alone doesn’t mean you need feel lonely, especially not when staying apart is a course of action collectively undertaken. Hermits meditate on life’s deeper meaning but they’ve traditionally also chosen habitats in which keeping body and soul together is a daily challenge – and perhaps a welcome respite from the heavier intellectual work of answering the questions that tend to fill a silent void. Crusoe was particularly diligent when it came to the daily business of self-care. No wild goats to tame? Try sowing some seeds on your windowsill instead. Belief is what’s sustained many hermits over time – faith in the muse if not a religious deity. If you’ve ever wondered what echoes of long-forgotten longings and ambitions you might hear within yourself were life only quiet enough, then now is the time to find out – especially if you’re brave enough to switch off your internet connection. Finally, one of history’s rarer female hermit voices, the Christian mystic Julian of Norwich – who lived through the Black Death as a child and survived serious illness in adulthood – provides words to which we all, believers, agnostics and atheists alike, might cling: “All shall be well, and all shall be well and all manner of thing shall be well.”',\n",

       " \"The coronavirus pandemic is upon us, and for many people it feels like it came out of nowhere. The UK saw its first reported cases at the end of January, by which time the virus was already spreading around the world. But it was not until the middle of March that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson “advised” people to avoid non-essential travel and socialising, and only on 23 March did he order the country into lockdown. The slow UK response came in for widespread criticism from public health experts. In the US, President Donald Trump has overseen a chaotic response. The country has had a dire shortage of testing kits, so its government does not know how many people have had the disease. President Trump also repeatedly downplayed the dangers of the disease – although despite what you may have read he did not (quite) call it a hoax. He also incorrectly compared it to seasonal flu, and falsely claimed the US response was more comprehensive than any other country's. How did two of the most advanced countries in the world, with technology and expertise to spare, fail to recognise the crisis as it unfolded? A final answer will only come with hindsight and public inquiries, but there are many known psychological processes that cause individuals and organisations to miss the signs of a coming emergency – even when it is staring them in the face. In 1980, psychologist Neil Weinstein published the first study of what has come to be known as “optimism bias”. He found that people are “unrealistically optimistic” about their own future prospects. Weinstein asked over 200 students to rate their chances of experiencing different life events: either positive things like owning their own home or having a gifted child, or negative things like developing cancer or getting divorced. The students also rated the chances of other people in the group experiencing the same events. Most of the students thought they had better than average prospects, for example saying they were less likely to get cancer than everyone else, and more likely to own their own homes. “That’s been known and demonstrated in many different ways,” says Tali Sharot of University College London in the UK. Sharot says the root of the bias may be the way we learn new information. In a 2011 study, her team found that people are quicker to update their beliefs in response to information that is better than expected, compared to information that is worse than expected. It is easy to imagine how the optimism bias could affect our beliefs about Covid-19. If experts were to say that the lockdown would be eased in two weeks, people would quickly update their beliefs, says Sharot. But if the experts instead said it would last for longer than promised, people would update their beliefs less. “They say ‘I don’t really believe it’, ‘things change’, and so on,” she says. “As a consequence, you then generate these biased beliefs.” Indeed, there is already evidence that the bias is at work, possibly explaining why so many people have failed to adopt precautions like social distancing. For example, in a study that has not yet been peer-reviewed, Toby Wise of University College London in the UK and his colleagues surveyed 1,591 Americans on their beliefs and actions regarding the virus. While the volunteers’ awareness grew over time and they started taking protective measures, they underestimated their personal risk of infection, relative to the average person. Similarly, Benjamin Kuper-Smith of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf and his colleagues surveyed people in the UK, US and Germany. Their volunteers not only underestimated their risk of getting infected, they lowballed the chances of them passing the virus to others. “We are now conducting a large study, and our pilot data shows the same thing,” says Sharot. In her pilot, “not a single person said they were more likely to get the virus”. People are also susceptible to a subtler mistake, dubbed “outcome bias”. “A very obvious example is if you have two airplanes that nearly collide, but don’t,” says Robin Dillon-Merrill at Georgetown University in Washington DC. She says one possible response is, “Wow, that was really close, next time that could have happened” – which might prompt changes to current practice. However, often people do not respond like that. Instead they say, “Wow, I’m a fabulous pilot and my flight skills avoided that entirely”. This is outcome bias: the fact things turned out OK can cause us to underestimate how close they came to going badly wrong. Outcome bias was described by Jonathan Baron and John Hershey in 1988. They gave volunteers descriptions of decisions other people had taken in uncertain situations, such as gambling. The volunteers were asked to rate the other people’s decision-making and reasoning. They rated the other people more highly if the outcomes were favourable – even though chance played a large role in the outcomes. In other words, the fact the decisions happened to work out caused the volunteers to overrate the reasoning that went into making them. The Covid-19 epidemic is a clear instance of governments and organisations not having learned from near misses. In the past 20 years there have been two outbreaks of diseases caused by coronaviruses, the group to which the new virus belongs. The Sars outbreak of 2003 and 2004 killed at least 774 people before it was contained, while the ongoing Mers outbreak which began in 2012 has killed 858. Covid-19 has already far surpassed both, at more than 76,500 deaths at the time of writing. “I don’t think that we’re experiencing anything like a near-miss at the moment, unfortunately,” says Dillon-Merrill. “This is not a near-miss, this is an absolute hit.” Even if people are presented with clear evidence that a crisis is unfolding, they may deny the reality of it. Many psychological factors contribute to denial, but a crucial one is confirmation bias. If people are motivated to believe something, they may only seek out evidence which supports that point of view, and ignore or dismiss anything that contradicts it. Dillon-Merill points to a recent story from the Los Angeles Times. On 8 March, a woman celebrated her 70th birthday with a party at the Trump National Golf Club in southern California. A week later it emerged that one partygoer had tested positive for Covid-19. Many other attendees soon tested positive. Guests had been advised not to attend if they were ill, but that was not enough. “A lot of people who are transferring the virus don’t have symptoms,” says Dillon-Merrill. But everyone rationalised that away. “With the confirmation bias, you find the data that supports your position,” she says. “What you really want to see is: ‘I’m healthy. I really want to have my party’. We assume nobody’s showing symptoms and nobody’s coughing on anybody else, why can’t we have our party?” The story also illustrates another problem: in uncertain situations, we look to each other for guidance, but our neighbours are not always the best guides. “I think a very strong influence of all of this is social norms,” says Dillon-Merill. “Because the information is not clear, it’s changing or it’s uncertain, people are looking for clues and cues, and are tending to do what they see is the social norm.” This may explain so-called panic buying of unnecessary items like bottled water. If you see other stocking up on bottled water, you may do it too. Our tendency to conform can be beneficial, but in this case it is hurting us. At the level of government and other big organisations, this tendency to conformity can manifest as “groupthink”. Intelligent and experienced decision-makers sometimes stop discussing the various options openly and instead uncritically accept whatever plan they think everyone else is settling on. Groupthink was first described by psychologist Irving Janis in the early 1970s, most notably in his book Victims of Groupthink. Janis studied President John F Kennedy’s decision-making in two international incidents: the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961, and the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. The Bay of Pigs was a major US foreign policy failure, and Janis found that Kennedy’s advisers were reluctant to contradict him or each other. “With the Cuban Missile Crisis, a lot more of the meetings happened without him in the room, where they were forced to come up with alternative ideas, and that forced people to weigh the pros and cons of ideas,” says Dillon-Merrill. “The simplest idea to overcome groupthink is a better-structured process for making decisions.” There is a related concept called “functional stupidity”, described by Mats Alvesson at Lund University in Sweden and Andre Spicer at City University of London in the UK. The pair found that organisations often hire clever and talented people, but then create cultures and decision-making processes that do not encourage them to raise concerns or make suggestions. Instead, everyone is encouraged to emphasise positive interpretations of events, leading to “self-reinforcing stupidity”. The good news is that it is possible to overcome all these biases, but it requires changing the way many organisations work. Let’s start with the optimism bias, which arises because we learn better from good news than from bad. Sharot has found that if we are stressed, this reverses and we become better at learning from unexpectedly bad developments. The implication is that a bit of stress at work is good, because it will help us learn about threats and thus mitigate them. As for the outcome bias, which causes us to dismiss near misses, Dillon-Merrill and her colleagues have found that having an organisational culture that emphasises safety can make all the difference. This is easiest when the dangers of the near miss are obvious, for instance when a plane’s engine catches fire. It is harder if the near-miss is a subtle one, but a well-run organisation can still learn from such near misses. The structure and culture of an organisation are key, says Kathleen Sutcliffe at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. Crises do not come out of nowhere, but are the most extreme versions of things that happen all the time, so it is possible to anticipate them in outline and build up resilience. Sutcliffe and her colleagues have identified five characteristics of the best-prepared “high-reliability” organisations, which rarely experience disasters. First, such organisations are “preoccupied with failure”, says Sutcliffe. “What I mean by that is they understood what they wanted to achieve, but they also thought a lot about the ways in which they could get sidetracked and the ways in which things could go wrong.” This includes taking near misses seriously. “When you say ‘preoccupied with failure’, people jump to the conclusion that you’re not very positive and can’t celebrate successes. That’s not at all what we’re saying,” she emphasises. High-reliability organisations also encourage their employees to avoid simplification and embrace complexity, even if that means abandoning appealing positive narratives. They spend most of their time focusing on the here and now, rather than on big-picture strategy. They build resilience, mostly by ensuring that their staff have the time and encouragement to tackle problems rather than sweeping them under the carpet. And finally, they have flexible decision-making structures, meaning decisions can variously be made by low-ranking people on the ground and upper management, depending on the nature of the crisis. If governments want to avoid being caught flat-footed by the next pandemic-level crisis, they might do well to take some of Sutcliffe’s advice. Otherwise their human biases may betray them – again.

       " \"The coronavirus pandemic is upon us, and for many people it feels like it came out of nowhere. The UK saw its first reported cases at the end of January, by which time the virus was already spreading around the world. But it was not until the middle of March that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson “advised” people to avoid non-essential travel and socialising, and only on 23 March did he order the country into lockdown. The slow UK response came in for widespread criticism from public health experts. In the US, President Donald Trump has overseen a chaotic response. The country has had a dire shortage of testing kits, so its government does not know how many people have had the disease. President Trump also repeatedly downplayed the dangers of the disease – although despite what you may have read he did not (quite) call it a hoax. He also incorrectly compared it to seasonal flu, and falsely claimed the US response was more comprehensive than any other country's. How did two of the most advanced countries in the world, with technology and expertise to spare, fail to recognise the crisis as it unfolded? A final answer will only come with hindsight and public inquiries, but there are many known psychological processes that cause individuals and organisations to miss the signs of a coming emergency – even when it is staring them in the face. In 1980, psychologist Neil Weinstein published the first study of what has come to be known as “optimism bias”. He found that people are “unrealistically optimistic” about their own future prospects. Weinstein asked over 200 students to rate their chances of experiencing different life events: either positive things like owning their own home or having a gifted child, or negative things like developing cancer or getting divorced. The students also rated the chances of other people in the group experiencing the same events. Most of the students thought they had better than average prospects, for example saying they were less likely to get cancer than everyone else, and more likely to own their own homes. “That’s been known and demonstrated in many different ways,” says Tali Sharot of University College London in the UK. Sharot says the root of the bias may be the way we learn new information. In a 2011 study, her team found that people are quicker to update their beliefs in response to information that is better than expected, compared to information that is worse than expected. It is easy to imagine how the optimism bias could affect our beliefs about Covid-19. If experts were to say that the lockdown would be eased in two weeks, people would quickly update their beliefs, says Sharot. But if the experts instead said it would last for longer than promised, people would update their beliefs less. “They say ‘I don’t really believe it’, ‘things change’, and so on,” she says. “As a consequence, you then generate these biased beliefs.” Indeed, there is already evidence that the bias is at work, possibly explaining why so many people have failed to adopt precautions like social distancing. For example, in a study that has not yet been peer-reviewed, Toby Wise of University College London in the UK and his colleagues surveyed 1,591 Americans on their beliefs and actions regarding the virus. While the volunteers’ awareness grew over time and they started taking protective measures, they underestimated their personal risk of infection, relative to the average person. Similarly, Benjamin Kuper-Smith of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf and his colleagues surveyed people in the UK, US and Germany. Their volunteers not only underestimated their risk of getting infected, they lowballed the chances of them passing the virus to others. “We are now conducting a large study, and our pilot data shows the same thing,” says Sharot. In her pilot, “not a single person said they were more likely to get the virus”. People are also susceptible to a subtler mistake, dubbed “outcome bias”. “A very obvious example is if you have two airplanes that nearly collide, but don’t,” says Robin Dillon-Merrill at Georgetown University in Washington DC. She says one possible response is, “Wow, that was really close, next time that could have happened” – which might prompt changes to current practice. However, often people do not respond like that.

       " 'With a ban on non-essential travel and some countries in complete lockdown, we’re able to witness what happens to the Earth when we’re largely absent for the first time. As a travel journalist and someone who cares deeply about the future of our planet, the moral dilemma of air travel is something I constantly grapple with. I’ve reduced the number of trips I take, buy carbon offsets when I travel and focus my assignments on stories that allow me to tackle conservation issues whenever possible. But the positive effect these measures have had is hard to quantify. What isn’t as nebulous is this: when the world stays home, the planet benefits. There’s nothing good about the coronavirus, but with a ban on non-essential travel and some countries in lockdown, we’re able to witness what happens to the Earth when we’re largely absent for the first time. Satellite images published by NASA and the European Space Agency detected a reduction in nitrogen dioxide emissions (which come predominantly from the burning of fossil fuels) from January to February in China, due to the economic slowdown during quarantine. Findings by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) show that China’s carbon dioxide emissions (which also come from fossil fuel combustion) have reduced by 25% because of measures taken to contain the coronavirus. During Italy’s quarantine, similar satellite data has shown a drop in nitrogen dioxide emissions in the country’s northern region; and waterways in Venice appear cleaner because of a drastic reduction in tourist boat traffic (though, much to the chagrin of animal lovers, the photos circulating of dolphins frolicking in the canals were actually taken nearly 800km away in Sardinia). In India, a nationwide curfew on 22 March resulted in the lowest average level of nitrogen dioxide pollution ever recorded in spring, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). And as North America (one of the world’s major polluters) enters a major economic downturn, it’s likely we’ll see similar effects there. Of course, a global health crisis is not the answer to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but the phenomenon should give us cause to reflect on the impact human activity has on the planet – including how we travel. Restrictions on non-essential travel means airlines are grounding planes, drastically slashing flights or suspending operations completely. While data on the specific environmental outcomes of reduced aviation is yet to be published, we know it’s likely to have a significant impact. A 2017 study conducted by researchers at the Lund University Centre for Sustainability Studies in Sweden (LUCSUS) in partnership with the University of British Columbia showed that there are three personal choices we can make to quickly cut a lot of greenhouse gas emissions: reduce air and car travel, as well as meat consumption. A 2018\\xa0study\\xa0published in Nature Climate Change showed that emissions from tourism add up to 8% of the global total, with flying making up the largest share of this. “By far, the biggest action we can take is to stop flying or to fly less,” said Kimberly Nicholas, a sustainability scientist at LUCSUS. “One round-trip flight from New York to London is the equivalent of about two years of eating meat [in terms of personal carbon footprint].” “There\\'s just no way to have a safe climate and the business-as-usual plan with the aviation industry,” said Nicholas. If we want to meet the Paris Agreement’s target of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by 2030, we need to make significant changes to how we travel. Part of this is going to have to come from within the airline and transportation industries. Some airlines are making headway through research into innovations like biofuel and electric-powered aircraft. “There\\'s still a lot of potential fuel economy that could be gained from redesigning aircraft to be more efficient,” said Colin Murphy, deputy director of The Policy Institute for Energy, Environment and the Economy at University of California, Davis. “If you\\'re using waste oil, biofuels typically get about 60% greenhouse gas reductions compared to conventional petroleum,” he added. The amount of land needed to grow new sources of biofuel – renewable fuel derived from organic materials – could pose a problem, however. And while there’s potential for electric-powered aircraft, Murphy notes that limited battery technology means this will never be a viable solution for long-haul flights. Even if we succeed with these technological innovations, we still need to change our approach to travel as individuals. Just as the planet seems to be taking a breath right now, we’ve also been offered an opportunity for introspection. The coronavirus pandemic has forced us to see how interconnected the people, systems and organisations in our world are. While this revelation has been devastating in terms of how quickly the virus has spread globally, it’s also shown us how we’re able to unite and act as individuals for the collective good. We’ve practised social distancing to protect the elderly and immune-compromised; we’ve cheered healthcare workers on from our balconies; and shared the message to #stayhome on social media. When Covid-19 is behind us, we need to once again look outside ourselves and take individual action for the good of the planet. Just as coronavirus has forced our lives to slow down, we should consider a slower, more thoughtful approach to travel. There’s an authentic connection that comes with a place when we take the time to understand its people, culture and natural beauty in a meaningful way. This can’t be achieved with superficial port-to-port itineraries – we could also do without the environmental wreckage that a lot of large cruise ships leave in their wake – or by hopping around to a legion of countries in two weeks. It might mean taking one longer trip per year instead of packing in five or six shorter ones, which would drastically reduce our carbon footprint. “Overtourism is just another form of overconsumption,” said Shannon Stowell, CEO of the Adventure Travel Trade Association and sustainable travel advocate. “I\\'m fine seeing tourism numbers lower overall and for the quality of tourism to increase, where people understand the destination better and have a positive impact on it versus overcrowding and pollution and wildlife habitat loss – which are all outcomes of too much tourism,” he added. We can also alleviate some of the environmental stress of travel simply by keeping more of our adventures local. “This is actually the biggest impact we can have,” said Nicholas. “I used to be a frequent flyer, but I’ve found other ways to find that kind of novelty and adventure. Basically, slow travel and self-powered travel.” This might look like enjoying your local beach instead of one in Mexico and saving your carbon budget for a more impactful trip. When we do fly, we can purchase carbon offsets. “Carbon offsets help and they absolutely move the needle,” said Murphy. They\\'re not as good as actually reducing the emissions from travel so you\\'re not completely undoing all the harm, but they help.” When trying to decide what kind of offset to purchase, it’s vital to donate to a project that’s additional, meaning that it didn’t exist beforehand. So, when you donate to a cause that’s protecting deforestation, make sure the land in question wasn’t going to be protected anyway. How we fly also matters. As enticing as the extra legroom in business class is, purchasing those seats also increases your carbon footprint because it means less passengers per plane. “The more densely packed you are, the lower your emissions are per passenger mile by quite a bit,” Murphy notes. “At a policy level, we need transparency about the true environmental impact of our choices, and we need prices to align with those impacts,” said Austin Brown, executive director of the Policy Institute at UC Davis. “For example, making first-class tickets cost more.” (The price tag on first-class seats is used to subsidise cheap economy tickets, reducing the overall cost of travel and allowing more people to fly.) When we’re on the ground in a destination, we can reduce our footprint by being respectful to the area’s culture and environment. “When you travel to a new place, you’re a guest in their home,” said Stowell. Part of accomplishing this is to choose sustainable accommodation and activities, and a green mode of transportation to explore the place you’re in. This might mean partnering with a sustainable local tour operator who is more familiar with the tourism landscape, which is also a way to give back to the local economy. To weed through eco-tourism greenwashing, travellers should be looking for tour operators with a transparent sustainability plan. “If you go on a company website and find a sustainable tourism plan, and you then see an impact report in the next 12 to 48 months, you know they’re putting their money where their mouth is,” said Shannon Guihan, chief sustainability officer at The Travel Corporation and\\xa0 their sustainable tourism non-profit, TreadRight, which has developed a checklist to help travellers adopt eco-friendly habits and be more conscious with their choices. “We still need travel,” Guihan added. “Tourism is one of the biggest employers in the world and there are destinations, worldwide, reliant on travel and tourism for survival.” Outside of the global tourism economy, travel has the potential to benefit all of us. When we travel in a meaningful way, we gain cross-cultural understanding and develop greater empathy for people outside of our immediate circle. Travel gives us the global perspective we need to care about the future of our home here on Earth. Throughout my career as a journalist, I’ve shared mint tea with Bedouins in the middle of the desert in Jordan, looked into the eyes of a mountain gorilla in the lush jungles of Rwanda and tracked tigers under a white-hot sun with local naturalists in India. These experiences have given me a deep appreciation for the vast, diverse, infinitely beautiful world we live in, and a desire to protect it. Our ability to wander has been temporarily taken from us, and never has it felt like more of a luxury. “This crisis might give us the opportunity to instill a new travel mindset,” said Stowell. “Travel is a privilege, not a right.” I can’t imagine a world without travel, but I know that if we don’t change how we travel, there won’t be a planet left for us to explore.

Of course, a global health crisis is not the answer to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but the phenomenon should give us cause to reflect on the impact human activity has on the planet – including how we travel. Restrictions on non-essential travel means airlines are grounding planes, drastically slashing flights or suspending operations completely. While data on the specific environmental outcomes of reduced aviation is yet to be published, we know it’s likely to have a significant impact. A 2017 study conducted by researchers at the Lund University Centre for Sustainability Studies in Sweden (LUCSUS) in partnership with the University of British Columbia showed that there are three personal choices we can make to quickly cut a lot of greenhouse gas emissions: reduce air and car travel, as well as meat consumption. A 2018\\xa0study\\xa0published in Nature Climate Change showed that emissions from tourism add up to 8% of the global total, with flying making up the largest share of this. “By far, the biggest action we can take is to stop flying or to fly less,” said Kimberly Nicholas, a sustainability scientist at LUCSUS. “One round-trip flight from New York to London is the equivalent of about two years of eating meat [in terms of personal carbon footprint].” “There\\'s just no way to have a safe climate and the business-as-usual plan with the aviation industry,” said Nicholas. If we want to meet the Paris Agreement’s target of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by 2030, we need to make significant changes to how we travel. Part of this is going to have to come from within the airline and transportation industries. Some airlines are making headway through research into innovations like biofuel and electric-powered aircraft. “There\\'s still a lot of potential fuel economy that could be gained from redesigning aircraft to be more efficient,” said Colin Murphy, deputy director of The Policy Institute for Energy, Environment and the Economy at University of California, Davis. “If you\\'re using waste oil, biofuels typically get about 60% greenhouse gas reductions compared to conventional petroleum,” he added. The amount of land needed to grow new sources of biofuel – renewable fuel derived from organic materials – could pose a problem, however. And while there’s potential for electric-powered aircraft, Murphy notes that limited battery technology means this will never be a viable solution for long-haul flights. Even if we succeed with these technological innovations, we still need to change our approach to travel as individuals. Just as the planet seems to be taking a breath right now, we’ve also been offered an opportunity for introspection. The coronavirus pandemic has forced us to see how interconnected the people, systems and organisations in our world are. While this revelation has been devastating in terms of how quickly the virus has spread globally, it’s also shown us how we’re able to unite and act as individuals for the collective good. We’ve practised social distancing to protect the elderly and immune-compromised; we’ve cheered healthcare workers on from our balconies; and shared the message to #stayhome on social media. When Covid-19 is behind us, we need to once again look outside ourselves and take individual action for the good of the planet. Just as coronavirus has forced our lives to slow down, we should consider a slower, more thoughtful approach to travel. There’s an authentic connection that comes with a place when we take the time to understand its people, culture and natural beauty in a meaningful way. This can’t be achieved with superficial port-to-port itineraries – we could also do without the environmental wreckage that a lot of large cruise ships leave in their wake – or by hopping around to a legion of countries in two weeks. It might mean taking one longer trip per year instead of packing in five or six shorter ones, which would drastically reduce our carbon footprint. “Overtourism is just another form of overconsumption,” said Shannon Stowell, CEO of the Adventure Travel Trade Association and sustainable travel advocate. “I\\'m fine seeing tourism numbers lower overall and for the quality of tourism to increase, where people understand the destination better and have a positive impact on it versus overcrowding and pollution and wildlife habitat loss – which are all outcomes of too much tourism,” he added. We can also alleviate some of the environmental stress of travel simply by keeping more of our adventures local. “This is actually the biggest impact we can have,” said Nicholas. “I used to be a frequent flyer, but I’ve found other ways to find that kind of novelty and adventure. Basically, slow travel and self-powered travel.” This might look like enjoying your local beach instead of one in Mexico and saving your carbon budget for a more impactful trip. When we do fly, we can purchase carbon offsets. “Carbon offsets help and they absolutely move the needle,” said Murphy. They\\'re not as good as actually reducing the emissions from travel so you\\'re not completely undoing all the harm, but they help.” When trying to decide what kind of offset to purchase, it’s vital to donate to a project that’s additional, meaning that it didn’t exist beforehand. So, when you donate to a cause that’s protecting deforestation, make sure the land in question wasn’t going to be protected anyway. How we fly also matters. As enticing as the extra legroom in business class is, purchasing those seats also increases your carbon footprint because it means less passengers per plane. “The more densely packed you are, the lower your emissions are per passenger mile by quite a bit,” Murphy notes. “At a policy level, we need transparency about the true environmental impact of our choices, and we need prices to align with those impacts,” said Austin Brown, executive director of the Policy Institute at UC Davis. “For example, making first-class tickets cost more.” (The price tag on first-class seats is used to subsidise cheap economy tickets, reducing the overall cost of travel and allowing more people to fly.) When we’re on the ground in a destination, we can reduce our footprint by being respectful to the area’s culture and environment. “When you travel to a new place, you’re a guest in their home,” said Stowell. Part of accomplishing this is to choose sustainable accommodation and activities, and a green mode of transportation to explore the place you’re in. This might mean partnering with a sustainable local tour operator who is more familiar with the tourism landscape, which is also a way to give back to the local economy. To weed through eco-tourism greenwashing, travellers should be looking for tour operators with a transparent sustainability plan. “If you go on a company website and find a sustainable tourism plan, and you then see an impact report in the next 12 to 48 months, you know they’re putting their money where their mouth is,” said Shannon Guihan, chief sustainability officer at The Travel Corporation and\\xa0 their sustainable tourism non-profit, TreadRight, which has developed a checklist to help travellers adopt eco-friendly habits and be more conscious with their choices. “We still need travel,” Guihan added. “Tourism is one of the biggest employers in the world and there are destinations, worldwide, reliant on travel and tourism for survival.” Outside of the global tourism economy, travel has the potential to benefit all of us. When we travel in a meaningful way, we gain cross-cultural understanding and develop greater empathy for people outside of our immediate circle. Travel gives us the global perspective we need to care about the future of our home here on Earth. Throughout my career as a journalist, I’ve shared mint tea with Bedouins in the middle of the desert in Jordan, looked into the eyes of a mountain gorilla in the lush jungles of Rwanda and tracked tigers under a white-hot sun with local naturalists in India. These experiences have given me a deep appreciation for the vast, diverse, infinitely beautiful world we live in, and a desire to protect it. Our ability to wander has been temporarily taken from us, and never has it felt like more of a luxury. “This crisis might give us the opportunity to instill a new travel mindset,” said Stowell. “Travel is a privilege, not a right.” I can’t imagine a world without travel, but I know that if we don’t change how we travel, there won’t be a planet left for us to explore.

       " 'As many countries urge populations to stay at home, many of us are paying more attention to our diets and how the food we eat can support our health. To help sort out the fact from the fiction, BBC Future is updating some of our most popular nutrition stories from our archive. Our colleagues at BBC Good Food are focusing on practical solutions for ingredient swaps, nutritious storecupboard recipes and all aspects of cooking and eating during lockdown. As many of us find ourselves confined to our houses due to social isolation measures, concerns tend to arise about the lack of sunlight – and possible vitamin D deficiency. For many, a go-to fix is to take supplements. The supplement, after all, has been touted as a near-miracle. Both vitamin D2 and D3 supplements are available over-the-counter without a prescription and have been linked to improving immunity, tiredness and muscle weakness, bone pain, and depression. They’ve also been said to help stave off cancer and the consequences of ageing. It may be little wonder that, according to research by market analysis company Mintel, a third of adults in the UK who take vitamin supplements count vitamin D among them. But the debate over whether all adults need to take vitamin D supplements is contentious. Few doubt the role that vitamin D plays in our bone health to regulate calcium and phosphate in the body, which is why those who have a vitamin D deficiency are particularly encouraged to address it. And that may be more people than you think: one study estimates that around 20% of the population in the UK has a profound vitamin D deficiency, for example. But some experts say that people with healthy levels have no need of vitamin D supplements – which would be most people. In other words, they argue that in healthy people, vitamin D is not, as some have hoped, a way to prevent disease. Despite its name, vitamin D is not a vitamin. Instead, it is a hormone that promotes the absorption of calcium in the body. The challenge is that, aside from a few foods like oily fish, vitamin D is hard to find in the average diet. But in the presence of \"ultraviolet B\" rays, our skin can produce its own from a common cholesterol. There are two main types of D. The first is vitamin D3, which is found in animals including fish and is the kind the skin makes when exposed to sunlight. The second is vitamin D2, which comes from plant-based foods including mushrooms. Studies have found that D3 is more effective, and the conclusions of a 2012 meta-analysis argue that D3 is the preferred choice for supplementation. Today, the UK’s Public Health England (PHE) recommends every adult takes a 10-microgram supplement in autumn and winter, when the angle of the sunlight hitting the earth prevents as many UVB rays from penetrating the atmosphere. The government body also recommends that those at risk of lower vitamin D levels, including people with darker skin, take a supplement year-round. Other countries follow similar guidelines. In Canada, adults are advised to get 15 micrograms of vitamin D and have two servings of vitamin-D fortified milk or soy alternatives every day, while cow\\'s milk and margarine must be fortified with vitamin D by law. In the US, adults also are advised to get 15 micrograms, while much of the country’s milk, breakfast cereals, margarine, yogurts and orange juice is fortified, too. Those guidelines and fortification efforts came about largely in an attempt to fight rickets in the mid 20th Century. We know that low vitamin D levels reduce the body’s levels of calcium, which leads to a decrease in bone density and can cause rickets, particularly in babies and children. However, that advice has recently been expanded up, at least by the Association of UK Dieticians, in light of self-isolation during the current pandemic. In a post released in March 2020, as the UK entered spring, it said: \"If you are having to self isolate or if you are unable to go outside, you should consider taking a daily supplement containing 10 micrograms to ensure a healthy vitamin D status (for adults and children over the age of one).\" We know that low vitamin D may cause muscle weakness and fatigue. One study found that low vitamin D was high among people with fatigue and that their symptoms improved after five weeks of vitamin D supplements, while a small study from Newcastle University found that low vitamin D could cause fatigue as low levels cause mitochondria, the ‘power stations’ in every cell of the body, to be less efficient. Studies of cancer patients have found similar effects. Vitamin D may also help bolster and regulate the immune system by clearing bacteria. But vitamin D’s importance doesn’t necessarily mean people with healthy levels of vitamin D require supplements. Consider one of the most common reasons for supplementation: bone growth and maintenance. The current guidelines on how much vitamin D to take were informed by research involving the elderly population living in care homes, who don’t get as much exposure to the sun and are more prone to fractures and osteoporosis than the general population. But Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King\\'s College London, has argued that such studies are “probably flawed”. It’s true that the evidence isn’t clear-cut. One meta-analysis published in August 2018 concluded that increasing the levels of vitamin D in the general population is unlikely to decrease the risk of bone fractures in healthy people. And a meta-analysis of 81 studies found that vitamin D supplementation doesn’t prevent fractures or falls, or improve bone mineral density. The researchers concluded that guidelines should be updated to reflect this. But Sarah Leyland, osteoporosis nurse consultant at the National Osteoporosis Society, says vitamin D supplements may be useful for at-risk groups who don’t get any sunlight exposure. According to the NHS, people only need to be outside for a short period of time, with hands and forearms uncovered and without sunscreen, to get enough vitamin D between March and October. “We know that healthy people living in the community won’t reduce their fracture risk by taking calcium and vitamin D supplements,” Leyland says. “However, people who may not be getting enough – such as those who are housebound or live in sheltered accommodation – can benefit from these supplements.” Still, researchers haven’t found clear evidence of that, either. One meta-analysis examining the prevention of fractures in community, nursing home and hospital inpatient populations concluded that vitamin D alone is unlikely to prevent fractures in the doses and formulations tested so far in older people. And some evidence suggests that high doses can actually result in an increased number of fractures and falls. One randomised study found that high-dose monthly vitamin D supplements increased the risk of falls among the elderly population by 20-30% compared to those on a lower dose. There is also conflicting research on the relationship between vitamin D and other diseases, even ageing. One main claim is that vitamin D supplements will boost the immune system. Adrian Martineau, professor of respiratory infection and immunity at The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, who leads a research group on the effects of vitamin D on health, has found that vitamin D plays a role in improving respiratory infections. When his team analysed raw data from 25 clinical trials involving 11,000 patients from 14 countries, they found a small benefit to taking daily or weekly vitamin D supplements to reduce the risk of respiratory infections, asthma attacks and bronchitis. Although the paper soon attracted robust criticism, Martineau points out that the reduction of risk, while slight, is still significant and comparable to the effects of other health measures: to prevent a single respiratory infection, you’d have to give 33 people vitamin D supplements – compared to, for example, giving a flu vaccination to 40 people to prevent a single case of flu. Or take ageing. One paper looking at the link between vitamin D and life expectancy found that vitamin D3 can help with protein homeostasis – the process by which proteins are regulated within cells to maintain their health. “Our observation that D3 improves protein homeostasis and slows ageing highlights the importance of maintaining appropriate vitamin D serum levels,” the researchers write. But other studies have been less conclusive. One meta-analysis concluded that more research is needed to clarify the effect of vitamin D on mortality. The link between cardiovascular disease and vitamin D also has yet been properly established: the link could mean that heart disease is causing low vitamin D levels, not the other way around. This is an issue with nearly all of the studies that link low D to diseases. Ian Reid, professor in medicine at the University of Auckland, believes that diseases cause low vitamin D levels, as being unwell often leads to spending less time outdoors exposed to sunlight, rather than vice versa. “If you take any group of patients with almost any disease, their vitamin D levels will be lower than in a healthy individual. This has led some to hypothesise it’s low vitamin D developing the disease, but there’s no evidence to prove it,” he says. Researchers have found that higher vitamin D levels are associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer – it plays a role in stemming the formation of new blood vessels and stimulating better communication between cells. Vitamin D also has been found to help maintain normal levels of calcium in the colon, which slows growth of non-cancerous but high-risk cells. Other studies, including of the link between vitamin D and liver cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer, suggest there is good reason to think that low vitamin D plays a part in the spread of cancer cells. But taking supplements would then, surely, help stave off cancer – and a recent meta-analysis failed to find that supplementation reduced cancer risk. “This is likely to be a two-way street, with cancer causing vitamin D deficiency by affecting vitamin D metabolism, dietary intake and sun exposure, and vice versa via anti-proliferative effects of vitamin D. The two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive,” says Martineau. Another oft-discussed condition is seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a mood disorder caused by the seasonal drop in exposure to sunlight.\\xa0The link between light exposure and SAD is long-established. But again, a direct link to vitamin D has been difficult to prove. Evidence suggests there may be a relationship since vitamin D is associated with levels of both serotonin, important for mood regulation, and melatonin, which regulates our sleep. Low levels of either hormone could contribute to SAD symptoms. Researchers have yet to carry out a definitive randomised control trial, however, and the exact mechanism by which vitamin D bolsters the hormones is unknown. One theory is that vitamin D receptors – which are found in many parts of the brain and concentrated in the hypothalamus, a region involved in our circadian timing – play a part in controlling the body’s hormone levels. Research has found that vitamin D plays a wider role in our mental health, from depression to schizophrenia, as well as in brain development, but how it plays a role also remains unclear. A meta-analysis published earlier this year found that while there is a correlation between lower vitamin D levels and depression, that didn’t necessarily mean D caused depression. Again, perhaps depressed people just went out less and got less sunlight. If studies are inconclusive, though, perhaps that doesn’t reflect on the importance of vitamin D. Perhaps it’s the fact that most of them are based on supplements, not sunshine. Some scientists argue that getting vitamin D from supplements isn’t as effective as getting it straight from the sun, as the process that happens before the body makes vitamin D from sun exposure is more beneficial. More conclusive research around this is currently underway. Even so, most experts generally agree that even vitamin D supplements can benefit those who have very low levels. Martineau says his research found that those with low levels of vitamin D tend to see the most benefits of supplementation preventing respiratory infections, whereas the effects are a lot more modest when levels are moderately low. Reid says his studies have also shown benefits in those with low levels. But as most people have vitamin D levels above that threshold, they wouldn’t see benefits from supplementing. The trouble is that it can be difficult to predict who is at a highest risk of suffering from low vitamin D. As medical historian Roberta Bivins of the University of Warwick points out, the amount of vitamin D a person stores, and therefore requires over winter, isn’t just dependent on skin tone and the amount of time a person spend outdoors. “It’s very individual how much sun exposure a person needs during summer, depending on the pigment in the skin to the amount of fat in the body and how quickly your body makes new bone. It’s incredibly complicated,” she says. That’s why the best way to determine if you have low vitamin D is not by symptoms alone, but with a blood test arranged through your medic. Then there is the question of exactly what level of supplementation people need. Reid says there’s “no danger” in taking over-the-counter vitamin D of less than 25 nanomols per day. But with supplements offering doses as high as 62.5 micrograms available over the counter, there are concerns around the risk of excessive vitamin D levels, which can, in rare cases, cause side effects, including nausea and vomiting. In the long term, some studies suggest too much vitamin D can increase risk of cardiovascular disease, although the research isn’t conclusive. But others argue that even more vitamin D is needed. In 2012, chief medical officer Sally Davies wrote a letter to GPs urging them to recommend vitamin D supplements to all at-risk groups, writing that a “significant proportion” of people in the UK probably have inadequate levels of vitamin D. In June 2018, researchers from the University of Birmingham\\'s Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research wrote that the death of a baby from complications of heart failure caused by severe vitamin D deficiency, and the serious health complications of two others, was just the “tip of the iceberg” in vitamin D deficiencies among those at risk. Suma Uday, co-author of the paper and PhD doctoral researcher at the university, says these deficiencies occur because infant vitamin D supplementation programs are poorly implemented in the UK and not monitored. “In the infants we describe, deficiency occurred because infant vitamin D supplementation was not recommended or monitored. Any infant devoid of vitamin D for prolonged durations can develop low calcium levels, which can result in life threatening complications such as seizures and heart failure,” she says. With such conflicting results, it’s unsurprising that medical experts themselves are deeply divided over the benefits of widespread supplementation. Some even argue that vested interests are propping up the billion-dollar vitamin industry, with Spector calling vitamin D supplements a “pseudo-vitamin for a pseudo-disease”. While the debate continues, many experts are looking to Brigham and Women’s Hospital, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School in Boston, whose researchers are carrying out a long-awaited randomised trial, VIital, to investigate whether supplementation of vitamin D and omega 3 has any effect on cancer, stroke and heart disease in 25,000 adults. It’s hoped that these results, expected to publish later this year, will bring the debate closer to being resolved. In the meantime, it’s widely agreed that vitamin D supplements, especially over winter, will be a waste of money at worst.

Reid says his studies have also shown benefits in those with low levels. But as most people have vitamin D levels above that threshold, they wouldn’t see benefits from supplementing. The trouble is that it can be difficult to predict who is at a highest risk of suffering from low vitamin D. As medical historian Roberta Bivins of the University of Warwick points out, the amount of vitamin D a person stores, and therefore requires over winter, isn’t just dependent on skin tone and the amount of time a person spend outdoors. “It’s very individual how much sun exposure a person needs during summer, depending on the pigment in the skin to the amount of fat in the body and how quickly your body makes new bone. It’s incredibly complicated,” she says. That’s why the best way to determine if you have low vitamin D is not by symptoms alone, but with a blood test arranged through your medic. Then there is the question of exactly what level of supplementation people need. Reid says there’s “no danger” in taking over-the-counter vitamin D of less than 25 nanomols per day. But with supplements offering doses as high as 62.5 micrograms available over the counter, there are concerns around the risk of excessive vitamin D levels, which can, in rare cases, cause side effects, including nausea and vomiting. In the long term, some studies suggest too much vitamin D can increase risk of cardiovascular disease, although the research isn’t conclusive. But others argue that even more vitamin D is needed. In 2012, chief medical officer Sally Davies wrote a letter to GPs urging them to recommend vitamin D supplements to all at-risk groups, writing that a “significant proportion” of people in the UK probably have inadequate levels of vitamin D. In June 2018, researchers from the University of Birmingham\\'s Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research wrote that the death of a baby from complications of heart failure caused by severe vitamin D deficiency, and the serious health complications of two others, was just the “tip of the iceberg” in vitamin D deficiencies among those at risk. Suma Uday, co-author of the paper and PhD doctoral researcher at the university, says these deficiencies occur because infant vitamin D supplementation programs are poorly implemented in the UK and not monitored. “In the infants we describe, deficiency occurred because infant vitamin D supplementation was not recommended or monitored. Any infant devoid of vitamin D for prolonged durations can develop low calcium levels, which can result in life threatening complications such as seizures and heart failure,” she says. With such conflicting results, it’s unsurprising that medical experts themselves are deeply divided over the benefits of widespread supplementation. Some even argue that vested interests are propping up the billion-dollar vitamin industry, with Spector calling vitamin D supplements a “pseudo-vitamin for a pseudo-disease”. While the debate continues, many experts are looking to Brigham and Women’s Hospital, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School in Boston, whose researchers are carrying out a long-awaited randomised trial, VIital, to investigate whether supplementation of vitamin D and omega 3 has any effect on cancer, stroke and heart disease in 25,000 adults. It’s hoped that these results, expected to publish later this year, will bring the debate closer to being resolved. In the meantime, it’s widely agreed that vitamin D supplements, especially over winter, will be a waste of money at worst.

In uncertain – indeed, weird – times like these, as we increase our social isolation to ‘flatten the curve’, literature provides escape, relief, comfort and companionship. Less comfortingly, though, the appeal of pandemic fiction has also increased. Many pandemic titles read like guide books to today’s situation. And many such novels give a realistic chronological progression, from first signs through to the worst times, and the return of ‘normality’. They show us we’ve been through this before. We’ve survived. Daniel Defoe’s 1722 A Journal of the Plague Year, which chronicles the 1665 bubonic plague in London, gives an eerie play-by-play of events that recalls our own responses to the initial shock and voracious spread of the new virus. Defoe begins in September 1664, when rumours circulate of the return of ‘pestilence’ to Holland. Next comes the first suspicious death in London, in December, and then, come spring, Defoe describes how death notices posted in local parishes have taken an ominous rise. By July, the City of London enforces new rules \\xa0–\\xa0 rules now becoming routine in our 2020 shutdown, such as “that all public feasting, and particularly by the companies of this city, and dinners at taverns, ale-houses, and other places of common entertainment, be forborne till further order and allowance…” By August, Defoe writes, the plague is “very violent and terrible”; by early September it reaches its worst, with “whole families, and indeed whole streets of families… swept away together.” By December, “the contagion was exhausted, and also the winter weather came on apace, and the air was clear and cold, with sharp frosts… most of those that had fallen sick recovered, and the health of the city began to return.” When at last the streets are repopulated, “people went along the streets giving God thanks for their deliverance.” What could be more dramatic than taking a snapshot of a plague in progress, when tensions and emotions are heightened, and survival instincts kick in? The pandemic narrative is a natural for realistic novelists like Defoe, and later Albert Camus. Camus’ The Plague, in which the city of Oran in Algeria is shut down for months as the plague decimates its people (as happened in Oran in the 19th Century), also abounds with parallels to today’s crisis. Local leaders are reluctant at first to acknowledge the early signs of the plague dying rats littering the streets. “Are our city fathers aware that the decaying bodies of these rodents constitute a grave danger to the population?” asks a columnist in the local newspaper. The book’s narrator Dr Bernard Rieux reflects the quiet heroism of medical workers. “I have no idea what’s awaiting me, or what will happen when this all ends. For the moment I know this: there are sick people and they need curing,” he says. In the end, there’s the lesson learned by the plague’s survivors: “They knew now that if there is one thing one can always yearn for, and sometimes attain, it is human love.” The Spanish flu of 1918 reshaped the world, leading to the loss of 50 million people, on the heels of 10 million dead from World War One. Ironically, the dramatic global impact of the flu was overshadowed by the even more dramatic events of the war, which inspired countless novels. As people now practice ‘social distancing’ and communities around the globe withdraw into lockdown, Katherine Anne Porter’s description of the devastation created by the Spanish flu in her 1939 novel Pale Horse, Pale Rider feels familiar: “It’s as bad as anything can be... all the theatres and nearly all the shops and restaurants are closed, and the streets have been full of funerals all day and ambulances all night”, heroine Miranda’s friend Adam tells her shortly after she is diagnosed with influenza. Porter portrays Miranda’s fevers and medicines, and weeks of illness and recovery, before she awakens to a new world reshaped by losses from the flu and from the war.\\xa0Porter almost died from the plague of influenza herself. “I was in some strange way altered,” she told The Paris Review in a 1963 interview. “It took me a long time to go out and live in the world again. I was really ‘alienated’ in the pure sense.” Twenty-first Century epidemics – Sars in 2002, Mers in 2012, Ebola in 2014 – have inspired novels about post-plague desolation and breakdown, deserted cities and devastated landscapes. Margaret Atwood’s The Year of the Flood (2009) shows us a post-pandemic world with humans nearly extinct, most of the population wiped out 25 years before by the ‘Waterless Flood’ a virulent plague that “travelled through the air as if on wings, it burned through cities like fire”. Atwood captures the extreme isolation felt by the few survivors. Toby, a gardener, scans the horizon from her subsistence rooftop garden in a deserted spa. “There must be someone else left… she can’t be the only one on the planet. There must be others. But friends or foes? If she sees one, how to tell?” Ren, once a trapeze dancer – one of “the cleanest dirty girls in town” – is alive because she was in quarantine for a possible client-transmitted disease. She writes her name over and over. “You can forget who you are if you’re alone too much.” Through flashbacks, Atwood elaborates on how the balance between the natural and human worlds was destroyed by bio-engineering sponsored by the ruling\\xa0corporations, and how activists like Toby fought back. Always alert to the downside of science, Atwood bases her work on all-too-plausible premises, making The Year of the Flood terrifyingly prescient. What makes pandemic fiction so engaging is that humans are joined together in the fight against an enemy that is not a human enemy. There are no ‘good guys’ or ‘bad guys’; the situation is more nuanced. Each character has an equal chance to survive or not. The range of individual responses to dire circumstances makes intriguing grist for the novelist – and the reader. Ling Ma’s Severance (2018), which the author has described as an “apocalyptic office novel” with an immigrant backstory, is narrated by Candace Chen, a millennial who works at a Bible-publishing firm, and has her own blog. She is one of nine survivors who flee New York City during the fictitious 2011 Shen fever pandemic. Ma portrays the city after “the infrastructure had… collapsed, the Internet had caved into a sinkhole, the electrical grid had shut down.” Candace joins a road trip toward a mall in a Chicago suburb, where the group plans to settle. They travel through a landscape inhabited by the “fevered,” who are “creatures of habit, mimicking old routines and gestures” until they die. Are the survivors randomly immune?

It’s only a matter of time before she rebels. Our own current situation is, of course, nowhere near as extreme as the one envisaged in Severance. Ling Ma explores a worst-case scenario that, thankfully, we are not facing. In her novel, she looks at what happens in her imagined world after the pandemic fades away. After the worst, who is in charge of rebuilding a community, a culture? Among a random group of survivors, the novel asks, who decides who has power?

       " 'Often considered one of Italy’s most memorable dishes, beloved pizza is an ultimate comfort food and has become an ever-growing obsession around the world. When you think of Italy’s most memorable dishes, its beloved pizza will most likely be among your top five, if not top three, favourites. It’s an ultimate comfort food that has become an ever-growing obsession around the world. But what is it that makes pizza from Italy so special, and where do you find the very best? Like so many of the country’s most prized gastronomic delights like wine, olive oil and cheese, the quintessential pie from Naples, where pizza was born, has become so cherished that it’s now worthy of its own Designation\\xa0of Controlled\\xa0Origin (DOC). The city’s pizza-making tradition even received Unesco recognition in 2017 as an intangible cultural heritage item. Naples is, of course, the hub of the pizza napoletana (Neapolitan pizza), with generations of the same family groomed in the art of being a pizzaiolo (pizzamaker). And each family carefully guards its recipe variations and bakes pizza with a passion that’s matched perhaps only by the city’s love for its football team. There are three basic types of Neapolitan pizza: the Margherita, topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and fresh basil; the marinara, which skips the cheese and uses oregano and garlic instead of basil; and the “DOC” made with mozzarella di bufala (buffalo mozzarella) instead of the usual fior di latte made from cow’s milk. Pizza is said to have originated in the city in the 1700s, after explorers brought one of the essential ingredients, the tomato, from Peru. But even before that, Neapolitans had been eating a version of the pita brought from Arabic immigrants as a kind of flatbread – which eventually became “pizza” in the local dialect. Most upper-class Europeans viewed the new tomato import with suspicion and originally considered it to be poisonous; at no fault of the tomato, people would place the acidic fruits on pewter plates, from which they’d leach lead, causing illness. But in a time of almost famine, local Neapolitans started topping their humble but delicious flatbreads with tomatoes, and soon the creation became a staple of the city’s cuisine. Following the 1861 unification of the country, baker Raffaele Esposito was credited, in 1889, with inventing the now ubiquitous Margherita pizza in honour of the visit of Queen Margherita di Savoia, the wife of King Umberto the I, to the city. The colours of the Italian flag were mirrored in the ingredients: tomatoes for red; cheese for white; and basil for green. And thus, the iconic pizza was born. Today, there are more than 500 pizzerias in Naples, but only a fifth of them are certified by the True Neapolitan Pizza Association, an organisation that was created in 1984 to protect and distinguish the authentic pies from the wannabees. Its criteria is based not only on the ingredients that go into the pie – including everything from the type of flour in the dough to the provenance of the cheese – but also the preparation, from the dough fermentation style to oven temperature. The association now even holds an annual contest to judge which pizza makers are the best in the world. Franco Pepe from Pepe in Grani has won the last three years in a row. Pizza makers like Pepe have achieved a kind of rock-star status in Italy nowadays, but the work is quite physically exhausting, with a great attention given to seemingly simple methods. Among the most famous pizzaioli in town, Gino Sorbillo is a third-generation dough wizard who runs Gino e Toto Sorbillo pizzeria, which is often considered one of Naples’ best. His father was one of 21 children (number 19), all of whom helped with the family’s pizza-making business. It was the same for Sorbillo’s generation: “[The whole family] assisted in every step from buying the materials, [making] the dough and seeing how to treat the ingredients,” he explained. “But the most important thing was to see the humanity and connection there needs to be in a pizzeria,” as the pizza-making process requires manual labour, long hours, and, for the Sorbillo family, working in a humble and sometimes difficult part of town. His grandfather opened the family’s first pizza parlour back in 1935 along Via dei Tribunali, a historically troubled street in the centre of Naples that’s been rife with organised crime. That background has always been on Sorbillo’s mind, who wants to promote the city he loves and provide a refuge from gang activity for his patrons and workers. His Naples location was bombed last year, but ever determined, he has since reopened. Sorbillo now has pizzerias in places like Tokyo and New York, and although he monitors each one for its adherence to the family’s recipes, it’s this first location in Via dei Tribunali that remains the business’ centrepiece, where locals and tourists alike line up to taste the original pizza. The pizzeria has also helped breathe life into the city, which has a reputation for being the country’s most chaotic and among its poorest. “I think I also gave some younger people the inspiration that we could do something here in Naples, to say, ‘we are going to try to so something too’,” he said. To begin with, the dough has to be just right, with the use of Italian 00 or 0 wheat flour, fresh brewer’s yeast (no dry yeast), water and salt. The dough must be rolled by hand or with a slow speed mixer; never using a rolling pin. However, twirling it in the air to oxygenate the dough while belting out a Neapolitan classic might be best left to the professional pizzaioli. Ciro Salvo of 50 Kalò, another of the city’s most esteemed masters, has another dough-making must: “The fermentation and leavening of the dough must be at least 10 to 12 hours.” Raw, pureed tomatoes are another necessary ingredient for a great pie – preferably San Marzano, Italy’s most prized variety, which grow on the volcanic plains to the south of Mount Vesuvius and are required for pizzas with DOC designation. However, pizza star Franco Pepe prefers to use his own home-grown heirloom tomatoes. Only two types of mozzarella are used for Neapolitan pizza: fior di latte made from cow’s milk; or mozzarella di bufala, made from the milk of the water buffalo that live in the country’s Campania and Lazio regions. These days, at some farms, the gentle beasts receive massages and listen to classic music as part of their routine to produce the tastiest milk around. Of course, part of Neapolitan pizza’s fame comes from how it’s cooked. The dough must be no more than 3mm thick, and must bake for 60 to 90 seconds at a very high temperature – 485°C – inside a wood-burning oven, resulting in a pizza that’s crispy but not burnt. It all sounds easy enough, but there is a reason why some pizzamakers are considered true masters: that moment just before a pie becomes a burned mistake often lies in an expert’s eye. But even if you don’t have DOC-qualified ingredients or a wood-burning oven, according to Sorbillo, all you really need to make a good pie is flour, yeast, a can of tomatoes and cheese that’s made from cow’s milk. “It’s [how you make] the dough that’s essential,” he said. And as with any pastime, pizza-making involves a bit of trial and error. Mistakes and all, the whole process – along with getting to enjoy the final result – is all part of the fun. The True Neapolitan Pizza Association is holding a free contest called #VeraPizzaContest for pizza makers (amateur and professionals alike) to see who makes the best pizza designed and made at home. Entries close on 20 April. “I am lucky,” Salvo said. “It’s not just my work but my passion and my life.” He himself eats a Margherita pizza at least once a day. Ondine Cohane is co-author of Frances Mayes’ Always Italy published by National Geographic. This media cannot be played on your device. In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the cold tap water, and then mix in about two-thirds of the flour with a big spoon until a creamy consistency is formed. Mix in the salt, and then the remaining flour a little bit at a time. Continue to mix until all the flour has been absorbed. Knead energetically with your hands by folding the dough and pushing it inwards. When the dough is smooth and no longer has lumps, let it rest for 10-15 minutes. Dust the dough with flour, place it on a table and then give it a few folds, forming it into a spherical shape until it’s firm and elastic. Place dough inside an oiled baking tin and cover, and then allow it to rest and rise for 7-8 hours at room temperature. Place dough onto a round sheet pan that’s been lightly greased with olive oil, and lightly press it with your fingertips until the classical, flat-and-round pizza shape is formed (or into a square if using a square-shaped pan). It should be no more than 3mm thick. Cover and let rest for another 3 hours. Add tomatoes (or tomato puree) as desired onto the flattened dough, and put pizza on the base of the oven, baking at 250-280°C for 5-6 minutes. Move pizza to the top rack of the oven and bake for another 6-8 minutes, adding drained mozzarella (if using) only in the last 3-4 minutes. Other ingredients such as extra virgin olive oil and basil should be added at the end of cooking. Place already-prepared dough onto a baking sheet and lightly press flat. It should be no more than 3mm thick. Top with tomatoes and bake at 250-280°C for 5-6 minutes. Add escarole, black olives, capers, garlic and bake in the oven at 250-300°C for another 6-8 minutes. Add oregano and a trickle of olive oil. Culinary Roots is a series from BBC Travel connecting to the rare and local foods woven into a place’s heritage.

Like so many of the country’s most prized gastronomic delights like wine, olive oil and cheese, the quintessential pie from Naples, where pizza was born, has become so cherished that it’s now worthy of its own Designation\\xa0of Controlled\\xa0Origin (DOC). The city’s pizza-making tradition even received Unesco recognition in 2017 as an intangible cultural heritage item. Naples is, of course, the hub of the pizza napoletana (Neapolitan pizza), with generations of the same family groomed in the art of being a pizzaiolo (pizzamaker). And each family carefully guards its recipe variations and bakes pizza with a passion that’s matched perhaps only by the city’s love for its football team. There are three basic types of Neapolitan pizza: the Margherita, topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and fresh basil; the marinara, which skips the cheese and uses oregano and garlic instead of basil; and the “DOC” made with mozzarella di bufala (buffalo mozzarella) instead of the usual fior di latte made from cow’s milk. Pizza is said to have originated in the city in the 1700s, after explorers brought one of the essential ingredients, the tomato, from Peru. But even before that, Neapolitans had been eating a version of the pita brought from Arabic immigrants as a kind of flatbread – which eventually became “pizza” in the local dialect. Most upper-class Europeans viewed the new tomato import with suspicion and originally considered it to be poisonous; at no fault of the tomato, people would place the acidic fruits on pewter plates, from which they’d leach lead, causing illness. But in a time of almost famine, local Neapolitans started topping their humble but delicious flatbreads with tomatoes, and soon the creation became a staple of the city’s cuisine. Following the 1861 unification of the country, baker Raffaele Esposito was credited, in 1889, with inventing the now ubiquitous Margherita pizza in honour of the visit of Queen Margherita di Savoia, the wife of King Umberto the I, to the city. The colours of the Italian flag were mirrored in the ingredients: tomatoes for red; cheese for white; and basil for green. And thus, the iconic pizza was born. Today, there are more than 500 pizzerias in Naples, but only a fifth of them are certified by the True Neapolitan Pizza Association, an organisation that was created in 1984 to protect and distinguish the authentic pies from the wannabees. Its criteria is based not only on the ingredients that go into the pie – including everything from the type of flour in the dough to the provenance of the cheese – but also the preparation, from the dough fermentation style to oven temperature. The association now even holds an annual contest to judge which pizza makers are the best in the world. Franco Pepe from Pepe in Grani has won the last three years in a row. Pizza makers like Pepe have achieved a kind of rock-star status in Italy nowadays, but the work is quite physically exhausting, with a great attention given to seemingly simple methods. Among the most famous pizzaioli in town, Gino Sorbillo is a third-generation dough wizard who runs Gino e Toto Sorbillo pizzeria, which is often considered one of Naples’ best. His father was one of 21 children (number 19), all of whom helped with the family’s pizza-making business. It was the same for Sorbillo’s generation: “[The whole family] assisted in every step from buying the materials, [making] the dough and seeing how to treat the ingredients,” he explained. “But the most important thing was to see the humanity and connection there needs to be in a pizzeria,” as the pizza-making process requires manual labour, long hours, and, for the Sorbillo family, working in a humble and sometimes difficult part of town. His grandfather opened the family’s first pizza parlour back in 1935 along Via dei Tribunali, a historically troubled street in the centre of Naples that’s been rife with organised crime. That background has always been on Sorbillo’s mind, who wants to promote the city he loves and provide a refuge from gang activity for his patrons and workers. His Naples location was bombed last year, but ever determined, he has since reopened. Sorbillo now has pizzerias in places like Tokyo and New York, and although he monitors each one for its adherence to the family’s recipes, it’s this first location in Via dei Tribunali that remains the business’ centrepiece, where locals and tourists alike line up to taste the original pizza. The pizzeria has also helped breathe life into the city, which has a reputation for being the country’s most chaotic and among its poorest. “I think I also gave some younger people the inspiration that we could do something here in Naples, to say, ‘we are going to try to so something too’,” he said. To begin with, the dough has to be just right, with the use of Italian 00 or 0 wheat flour, fresh brewer’s yeast (no dry yeast), water and salt. The dough must be rolled by hand or with a slow speed mixer; never using a rolling pin. However, twirling it in the air to oxygenate the dough while belting out a Neapolitan classic might be best left to the professional pizzaioli. Ciro Salvo of 50 Kalò, another of the city’s most esteemed masters, has another dough-making must: “The fermentation and leavening of the dough must be at least 10 to 12 hours.” Raw, pureed tomatoes are another necessary ingredient for a great pie – preferably San Marzano, Italy’s most prized variety, which grow on the volcanic plains to the south of Mount Vesuvius and are required for pizzas with DOC designation. However, pizza star Franco Pepe prefers to use his own home-grown heirloom tomatoes. Only two types of mozzarella are used for Neapolitan pizza: fior di latte made from cow’s milk; or mozzarella di bufala, made from the milk of the water buffalo that live in the country’s Campania and Lazio regions. These days, at some farms, the gentle beasts receive massages and listen to classic music as part of their routine to produce the tastiest milk around. Of course, part of Neapolitan pizza’s fame comes from how it’s cooked. The dough must be no more than 3mm thick, and must bake for 60 to 90 seconds at a very high temperature – 485°C – inside a wood-burning oven, resulting in a pizza that’s crispy but not burnt. It all sounds easy enough, but there is a reason why some pizzamakers are considered true masters: that moment just before a pie becomes a burned mistake often lies in an expert’s eye. But even if you don’t have DOC-qualified ingredients or a wood-burning oven, according to Sorbillo, all you really need to make a good pie is flour, yeast, a can of tomatoes and cheese that’s made from cow’s milk. “It’s [how you make] the dough that’s essential,” he said. And as with any pastime, pizza-making involves a bit of trial and error. Mistakes and all, the whole process – along with getting to enjoy the final result – is all part of the fun. The True Neapolitan Pizza Association is holding a free contest called #VeraPizzaContest for pizza makers (amateur and professionals alike) to see who makes the best pizza designed and made at home. Entries close on 20 April. “I am lucky,” Salvo said. “It’s not just my work but my passion and my life.” He himself eats a Margherita pizza at least once a day.

In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the cold tap water, and then mix in about two-thirds of the flour with a big spoon until a creamy consistency is formed. Mix in the salt, and then the remaining flour a little bit at a time. Continue to mix until all the flour has been absorbed. Knead energetically with your hands by folding the dough and pushing it inwards. When the dough is smooth and no longer has lumps, let it rest for 10-15 minutes. Dust the dough with flour, place it on a table and then give it a few folds, forming it into a spherical shape until it’s firm and elastic. Place dough inside an oiled baking tin and cover, and then allow it to rest and rise for 7-8 hours at room temperature. Place dough onto a round sheet pan that’s been lightly greased with olive oil, and lightly press it with your fingertips until the classical, flat-and-round pizza shape is formed (or into a square if using a square-shaped pan). It should be no more than 3mm thick. Cover and let rest for another 3 hours. Add tomatoes (or tomato puree) as desired onto the flattened dough, and put pizza on the base of the oven, baking at 250-280°C for 5-6 minutes. Move pizza to the top rack of the oven and bake for another 6-8 minutes, adding drained mozzarella (if using) only in the last 3-4 minutes. Other ingredients such as extra virgin olive oil and basil should be added at the end of cooking. Place already-prepared dough onto a baking sheet and lightly press flat. It should be no more than 3mm thick. Top with tomatoes and bake at 250-280°C for 5-6 minutes. Add escarole, black olives, capers, garlic and bake in the oven at 250-300°C for another 6-8 minutes. Add oregano and a trickle of olive oil. Culinary Roots is a series from BBC Travel connecting to the rare and local foods woven into a place’s heritage.

       " 'You’ve probably noticed how some of your colleagues take to leadership roles like a duck to water. They’re confident telling others what to do, and happy taking on an ever-growing number of responsibilities. It couldn’t be more different for others: bossing around people feels awkward, and a nagging self-doubt shadows every decision. If you’re in the latter group, you might wonder why the thought of being a leader fills you with dread, and why you find it so hard to even see yourself as a manager. As with almost any aspect of human nature, some of the answer comes down to your genetically inherited disposition. If your parents were shrinking violets, the odds are increased that you will be too. But that’s far from the whole story. Increasingly, psychologists are realising the important part that early life experiences play. And key here is the way your parents behaved toward you. In particular, if they were overly protective they might have undermined your chances of becoming a future leader. Colloquially, this parenting approach is known as ‘helicopter parenting’ in reference to the idea of hovering nearby whether needed or not. Your parents likely had good intentions, such as ensuring you didn’t face uncomfortable challenges. Unfortunately this might have had some inadvertent, unhelpful effects, including “making you less confident and less capable of facing difficulties, therefore [leading you to] exhibit poorer leadership skills”, says Dr Judith Locke, a clinical psychologist in private practice and visiting fellow at Queensland University of Technology. Locke’s research has involved surveying parenting professionals, including psychologists and school counsellors, to establish exactly what they mean by helicopter parenting or overparenting. Her findings suggest this is an approach characterised by a mixture of three factors: being extremely responsive to the child, being extremely undemanding in some contexts, yet being highly demanding in others. For instance, a helicopter parent is likely to be overprotective, overly attentive and believe their child is always right. They will try to do everything for their child (rather than expecting the child to handle it themselves), and might expect their child’s peers and school to bend over backwards to accommodate their child’s needs too. At the same time, this kind of parent will be highly demanding, in the sense of having high expectations for their child’s achievements, overscheduling their child’s time and wanting their child to be their friend and in constant contact. The latest research on how this extreme coddling can stifle leadership skills comes from China. Psychologists surveyed nearly 1,500 teenagers – average age 14 – at 13 schools in Beijing. Yufang Bian at Beijing Normal University and her colleagues assessed the teenagers’ leadership potential comprehensively. First they quizzed the teenagers’ peers, teachers and parents to get a sense of whether they were seen by others as being a good leader. Second, they checked whether the teenagers were actually in any leadership roles, such as being a team leader in a class science group or a president in a student club. Meanwhile, the teenagers rated how much their parents had been overprotective by agreeing or disagreeing with statements such as ‘My parents supervised my every move growing up’ and ‘My parents often stepped in to solve life problems for me’. The teens also took quizzes measuring their self-esteem and how confident they felt about being a leader. After controlling for the influence of a number of other factors, such as family socioeconomic background and the teenagers’ academic achievements, Bian and her team found a clear pattern.\\xa0The more overprotective their parents, the less the teens were perceived as having leadership potential by others, and the less likely they were to actually be in leadership roles. Statistically, this link was explained by the fact that the teens with helicopter parents tended to have lower self-esteem, which in turn was associated with being less confident about being a leader. Bian and her team said their findings support the idea that too much of a good thing can be harmful: “In the same way that a lack of proper parenting harms a child’s development, overparenting, with its restriction of the child’s development of autonomy and problem-solving skills, also has a negative impact on psychosocial development.” Overparenting may also create this undermining effect because it signals to children that they are not capable of independence and that their parents don’t trust them to look after themselves, let alone others. It is worth mentioning that these new findings should be interpreted with caution because the observational design of the study means it hasn’t proved that helicopter parenting causes a lack of emerging leadership potential. The research relies on teenagers retrospectively recalling their parents’ behaviour, and it’s possible that teens with lower self-esteem might be tempted to rate their parents unfavourably as a way to explain their current feelings. However, the results are consistent with a causal interpretation and the researchers build on a wealth of earlier research, which has consistently shown the apparent detrimental effects of having overprotective parents, albeit that these studies have also featured an observational design. For instance, psychologists at Florida State University surveyed nearly 500 undergraduates and found that those who had helicopter parents also tended to be less confident in their own abilities. A different team at Miami University quizzed hundreds of undergraduates and found similar results. Those who described having helicopter parents also tended to have more emotional problems, struggled with making decisions and performed worse in their exams. If you run a mile from leadership opportunities and recognise the description of having helicopter parents, you don’t have to accept that you’ll never be a leader or exhibit qualities of one. First, remember your parents’ approach was likely well intentioned, and\\xa0you won’t benefit from feeling resentful. You’re in control now and, with dedication and effort, it’s possible to shape your own traits and attitudes at any time of life. Locke, who is also the author of The Bonsai Child (a parenting book to help parents develop their child’s potential by not overparenting), recommends beginning to take more control over your own life, including being more financially independent if you can, and avoiding the temptation to call your parents each time you have a problem. “Many readers will have parents still wanting to be highly involved in their lives. Work out a way where you manage your own life more and cease to rely on your parents as much,” she says. Of course, these changes on their own won’t transform you into a leader, but they will help you to see yourself as independent and to be more comfortable making autonomous decisions, which will serve you well if and when leadership opportunities arise in your career. You can also make changes at work, including trying to be more open to criticism, and being proactive in seeking feedback. “My work shows that those who have been overprotected have often been overpraised as a matter of course, and don’t cope as well with constructive criticism,” says Locke. “For you to improve you need to be open to suggestions of what you need to do to progress.” It won’t happen overnight, but through practising being more independent and taking the time and effort to build your emotional and decision-making skills, you will find that you can slowly build your confidence – and even start to see yourself as a potential boss.

       " 'Apocalyptic films feature disease, war or alien invasions – but there’s one thing they almost always avoid. Nicholas Barber asks why Hollywood is still so squeamish about the real environmental crisis. Whether you believe that art imitates life or life imitates art, it often seems as if the 21st Century is imitating a Hollywood blockbuster. At the moment, as many of us have observed, the current situation seems to be echoing Contagion and 28 Days Later. Before that, the climate crisis – with its news reports about hurricanes, tidal waves and wildfires – felt like every mega-budget movie about a world-shaking apocalypse. The strange thing is, though, that despite the uneasy connection between environmental news reports and apocalyptic films, climate change is mentioned in hardly any of them. On the big screen, the threats to civilisation as we know it are war (The Book of Eli; Mad Max: Fury Road; Alita: Battle Angel), disease (Zombieland; World War Z; Contagion; Inferno), drugs that were intended to counteract disease (I Am Legend; Rise of the Planet of the Apes), alien invasions (Oblivion; Edge of Tomorrow; A Quiet Place), and demons (This Is The End). Clearly, this glut of doom-laden entertainment was responding to our anxieties about the state of the planet. But the idea that our carbon footprints might have something to do with it doesn’t get a look-in. In The Core (2003), the Earth’s core has stopped rotating, and nuclear explosions are required to jump start it. In Danny Boyle’s Sunshine (2007), it’s the Sun which is almost defunct, and again, nuclear explosions are what’s needed to bring it back to life. In Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar (2014), the problem is crop blights. In Alfonso Cuarón’s Children of Men (2006), it’s infertility. Then there is Bong Joon-ho’s Snowpiercer (2013), which the Korean director made a few years before the Oscar-winning Parasite. His dystopian action movie is set during a new ice age, but rather than being brought about by climate change per se, the catastrophe was caused by a misguided attempt to reverse it by “dispersing CW7 into the upper levels of the atmosphere”. The only major Hollywood feature film to have the opposite message is Roland Emmerich’s The Day After Tomorrow (2004). The German writer-director is best known for Independence Day and Godzilla, both of which gloried in mass destruction, but his interest in extreme weather conditions and ecological issues was evident decades earlier. The student film he made in 1984, The Noah’s Ark Principle (Das Arche Noah Prinzip), was set aboard a space station that could whip up torrential storms. In 1990, he released another science-fiction thriller, Moon 44, in which corporations were mining for minerals all across the galaxy, having used up the Earth’s natural resources. Then, once he was established in Hollywood, Emmerich used Art Bell and Whitley Strieber’s book, The Coming Global Superstorm, as the basis of his star-studded, 1970s-style disaster movie. Like his other films, The Day After Tomorrow is about as stupid and clichéd as cinema gets. But parts of it hold up remarkably well. The panic-buying scenes are all too prescient (although no one appears to be stockpiling toilet paper), and the satire has sharpened with age. When the US become largely uninhabitable, refugees pile south across the Rio Grande, but are not allowed into Mexico until all Latin American debt is cancelled. This conceit was bold enough in 2004, but today, in the ‘Build the Wall’ era, it seems revolutionary. More importantly, at least as far as Hollywood was concerned, The Day After Tomorrow was a box-office smash. The sixth highest grossing release of 2004 – just one place behind The Passion of the Christ – it proved that a film could have prominent environmental themes and still rake in several hundred million dollars. And yet it didn’t set a trend for climate-conscious eco-thrillers. The subject cropped up in documentaries, such as the Oscar-winning adaptation of Al Gore’s slide show, An Inconvenient Truth (2006). But directors of fictional films continued to shy away from climate change, and even Emmerich retreated from it. When he made another global disaster move, 2012 (2009), he blamed the worldwide floods in the film on... errr... neutrinos from a solar flare, as opposed to anything that human beings might have done. Perhaps the structure of The Day After Tomorrow can offer some clues as to why it is such a one-off. The film starts well, with a climate researcher, Professor Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), nearly plummeting to his doom in the Antarctic when a mile-long crack splits the ice shelf beneath his feet.\\xa0Soon afterwards, he explains how the North Atlantic Current works to the US’s sceptical vice president (Kenneth Welsh, a Dick Cheney lookalike), but Emmerich doesn’t keep things theoretical for long. Hailstones the size of tennis balls batter Tokyo. Tornadoes rip Los Angeles to pieces. Helicopters fall from the sky when their fuel lines freeze in Scotland. A frighteningly convincing tsunami sloshes through Manhattan, submerging its streets and turning its skyscrapers into islands. New York is then buried under metres of snow and ice. The science may be iffy, but these scenes are vivid enough to make anyone think twice about ordering a gas-guzzling new car. Once you’ve shown civilisation being flattened, though, where do you go next? Much of the film’s second half is given over to Jack’s teenage son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) trying to stave off frostbite in The New York Public Library, while Jack hikes through the snow to find him. These scenes are fine, but they can’t help but seem insignificant compared to the devastation we’ve just witnessed. Ultimately, who cares about Jack and Sam? Blockbuster movies tend to be about the heroes’ efforts to save thousands or millions of lives. They concoct a cure for a virus or they disarm a bomb. In Emmerich’s own canon, they topple a humungous mutant lizard (Godzilla) and they blow up a squadron of alien spacecraft (Independence Day). In contrast, all Jack does is reunite with his son; society at large is still in tatters. Could that be why climate change is so often overlooked by filmmakers? Because it’s just too big and overwhelming for a two-hour adventure? And because it can’t be fixed by a hero defeating a villain? In a way, almost every one of us is the villain of the story, due to our own small daily choices to take that flight, to eat that steak, and to upgrade that phone. It’s understandable that Hollywood studios don’t want to alienate audiences by reminding them of that inconvenient truth. Commercially speaking, it’s more sensible to blame the apocalypse instead on some mad scientist’s experiments or some foreign dictator’s nuclear missiles. It’s also true that Hollywood can’t complain about our environmental unfriendliness without drawing attention to its own. The average film is a paean to conspicuous consumption: an invitation to covet private jets, luxurious apartments, and designer outfits. And The Day After Tomorrow itself has its share of product placement. Behind the scenes, the industry isn’t much better. It relies on countless people flying all over the world, first to make a film and then to promote it in the most opulent possible fashion. In January, Stella McCartney boasted on Twitter that Joaquin Phoenix would be doing his bit for “the future of the planet” by wearing one dinner suit “for the entire award season”, ie, a couple of months. The tweet was roundly mocked, especially by those of us who have worn the same dinner suit for 20 years. Still, the statement was at least a sign that Hollywood is aware of its own bad habits. Other signs include the Producers Guild of America’s new Green Production Guide, and Sony’s move to install solar panels on its soundstages. But will James Bond ever swap his Aston Martin for a bicycle? Will Phoenix wear his Stella McCartney suit next award season? And, when the film business gets up and running again, will Hollywood start greenlighting some more disaster movies which face the climate crisis head on, as The Day After Tomorrow did?

The student film he made in 1984, The Noah’s Ark Principle (Das Arche Noah Prinzip), was set aboard a space station that could whip up torrential storms. In 1990, he released another science-fiction thriller, Moon 44, in which corporations were mining for minerals all across the galaxy, having used up the Earth’s natural resources. Then, once he was established in Hollywood, Emmerich used Art Bell and Whitley Strieber’s book, The Coming Global Superstorm, as the basis of his star-studded, 1970s-style disaster movie. Like his other films, The Day After Tomorrow is about as stupid and clichéd as cinema gets. But parts of it hold up remarkably well. The panic-buying scenes are all too prescient (although no one appears to be stockpiling toilet paper), and the satire has sharpened with age. When the US become largely uninhabitable, refugees pile south across the Rio Grande, but are not allowed into Mexico until all Latin American debt is cancelled. This conceit was bold enough in 2004, but today, in the ‘Build the Wall’ era, it seems revolutionary. More importantly, at least as far as Hollywood was concerned, The Day After Tomorrow was a box-office smash. The sixth highest grossing release of 2004 – just one place behind The Passion of the Christ – it proved that a film could have prominent environmental themes and still rake in several hundred million dollars. And yet it didn’t set a trend for climate-conscious eco-thrillers. The subject cropped up in documentaries, such as the Oscar-winning adaptation of Al Gore’s slide show, An Inconvenient Truth (2006). But directors of fictional films continued to shy away from climate change, and even Emmerich retreated from it. When he made another global disaster move, 2012 (2009), he blamed the worldwide floods in the film on... errr... neutrinos from a solar flare, as opposed to anything that human beings might have done. Perhaps the structure of The Day After Tomorrow can offer some clues as to why it is such a one-off. The film starts well, with a climate researcher, Professor Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), nearly plummeting to his doom in the Antarctic when a mile-long crack splits the ice shelf beneath his feet.\\xa0Soon afterwards, he explains how the North Atlantic Current works to the US’s sceptical vice president (Kenneth Welsh, a Dick Cheney lookalike), but Emmerich doesn’t keep things theoretical for long. Hailstones the size of tennis balls batter Tokyo. Tornadoes rip Los Angeles to pieces. Helicopters fall from the sky when their fuel lines freeze in Scotland. A frighteningly convincing tsunami sloshes through Manhattan, submerging its streets and turning its skyscrapers into islands. New York is then buried under metres of snow and ice. The science may be iffy, but these scenes are vivid enough to make anyone think twice about ordering a gas-guzzling new car. Once you’ve shown civilisation being flattened, though, where do you go next? Much of the film’s second half is given over to Jack’s teenage son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) trying to stave off frostbite in The New York Public Library, while Jack hikes through the snow to find him. These scenes are fine, but they can’t help but seem insignificant compared to the devastation we’ve just witnessed. Ultimately, who cares about Jack and Sam? Blockbuster movies tend to be about the heroes’ efforts to save thousands or millions of lives. They concoct a cure for a virus or they disarm a bomb. In Emmerich’s own canon, they topple a humungous mutant lizard (Godzilla) and they blow up a squadron of alien spacecraft (Independence Day). In contrast, all Jack does is reunite with his son; society at large is still in tatters. Could that be why climate change is so often overlooked by filmmakers? Because it’s just too big and overwhelming for a two-hour adventure? And because it can’t be fixed by a hero defeating a villain? In a way, almost every one of us is the villain of the story, due to our own small daily choices to take that flight, to eat that steak, and to upgrade that phone. It’s understandable that Hollywood studios don’t want to alienate audiences by reminding them of that inconvenient truth. Commercially speaking, it’s more sensible to blame the apocalypse instead on some mad scientist’s experiments or some foreign dictator’s nuclear missiles. It’s also true that Hollywood can’t complain about our environmental unfriendliness without drawing attention to its own. The average film is a paean to conspicuous consumption: an invitation to covet private jets, luxurious apartments, and designer outfits. And The Day After Tomorrow itself has its share of product placement. Behind the scenes, the industry isn’t much better. It relies on countless people flying all over the world, first to make a film and then to promote it in the most opulent possible fashion. In January, Stella McCartney boasted on Twitter that Joaquin Phoenix would be doing his bit for “the future of the planet” by wearing one dinner suit “for the entire award season”, ie, a couple of months. The tweet was roundly mocked, especially by those of us who have worn the same dinner suit for 20 years. Still, the statement was at least a sign that Hollywood is aware of its own bad habits. Other signs include the Producers Guild of America’s new Green Production Guide, and Sony’s move to install solar panels on its soundstages. But will James Bond ever swap his Aston Martin for a bicycle? Will Phoenix wear his Stella McCartney suit next award season? And, when the film business gets up and running again, will Hollywood start greenlighting some more disaster movies which face the climate crisis head on, as The Day After Tomorrow did?

       " \"As many countries urge populations to stay at home, many of us are paying more attention to our diets and how the food we eat can support our health. To help sort out the fact from the fiction, BBC Future is updating some of our most popular nutrition stories from our archive. Our colleagues at BBC Good Food are focusing on practical solutions for ingredient swaps, nutritious storecupboard recipes and all aspects of cooking and eating during lockdown. There are few experiences as universal as catching a cold. And while there are around 200 viruses that cause it, there seem to be almost as many home remedies to combat it. At the core of any home remedy is the idea that it bolsters our immune system. When a virus enters our bodies, it comes up against two systems of defence: the innate immune system tries to flush invading cells out, while the adaptive system targets specific pathogens that the body already has had contact with and creates memory cells of new ones, so the body can fight them off if they return. This is why we tend to get chicken pox only once, whereas the common cold – which changes its appearance as it passes from one person to the next, confusing our memory cells – is something we can experience dozens of times. It’s well-known that both lifestyle habits and diet affect the strength of our immune systems. But because the immune system is only impaired in otherwise healthy people when we have a vitamin or mineral deficiency, supplementing our diets with so-called cold-busting foods will make little difference if we already have a relatively good diet, says Charles Bangham, head of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Imperial College London. “Only if you’re short of a vital nutrient, such as vitamin, zinc or iron, will supplementing that particular item be very helpful. But if you eat a balanced diet, adding more of these things doesn’t make the immune system any more efficient,” he says. It should also be pointed out that many of the same remedies we're told can cure the common cold are also being circulated on social media with the promise that they can keep us safe during the current virus pandemic. Studies looking into cures for the common cold have found that they can make a difference. The vast majority of these studies concentrate on supplements, rather than food – in fact, no reliable research has been done on whether a popular cure like chicken soup actually makes a difference. But one supplement that may help is popular home remedy garlic. In one small study, 146 healthy adults were given either a placebo or a daily garlic supplement for 12 weeks over winter. The placebo group contracted 65 colds, resulting in 366 days of sickness – whereas those who had garlic supplements only contracted 24 colds, with 111 days of sickness between them. Another supplement many people reach for when they feel cold symptoms is vitamin C. Some research suggests it too can help – though not as much as you might think. One review analysing 29 studies on vitamin C supplements didn’t find that supplements greatly reduce the risk of getting colds, or that they alleviate symptoms. But it did find that children saw a 14% reduction in the length of their colds; in adults, the reduction was 8%. Researchers concluded that since the supplements are low-risk, it may be worthwhile trying them to see if they can help. Orange juice may be less useful: there is no robust evidence that orange juice helps prevent colds, alleviate symptoms or reduce a cold’s length. This is because it doesn’t contain high enough doses of vitamin C to have the same impact as daily supplements, says Harri Hemilä, a public health researcher at the University of Helsinki and author of the vitamin C supplements review. A standard small bottle of fresh orange juice has around 72mg of vitamin C, according to the US Department of Agriculture – that’s more than the recommended daily minimum of 40mg, but still less than many supplements. Then there’s zinc. One review examining the effectiveness of daily zinc acetate lozenges on the common cold found that they shortened the duration of runny and blocked noses by around a third, plus led to 22% less sneezing and almost half as much coughing. The study concluded that if started within 24 hours of the first symptoms, 80mg daily zinc acetate lozenges may help treat the common cold. However, Hemilä argues it’s more accurate to study recovering from a cold fully, rather than measuring symptom duration – which avoids data being affected by people dropping out of the study before fully recovering from their cold, and to avoid those with extended colds skewing the findings. His study of 199 common cold patients found that those with a cold who were given zinc lozenges recovered three times faster. Often, scientists say that vitamins and minerals are best consumed through foods, rather than supplements – though they point out that, as with vitamin C, it’s often easier to get high doses of a vitamin through supplements. For zinc, however, the opposite is true. In order to be effective against colds, zinc must come from lozenges and not from ordinary zinc tablets or zinc-rich foods, Hemilä says. “Zinc lozenges are slowly dissolved in the throat region and the effect of zinc is local,” he says. “We don’t know what the biochemical mechanism of this effect is. But studies finding zinc lozenges to be effective used large lozenges that have dissolved for up to 30 minutes in the mouth.” Still, one complication is that researchers haven’t tended to look at whether people were deficient in something like vitamin C or zinc before they started a regimen. So, any cold-fighting benefit might be down to the fact that by taking a supplement, some participants were correcting a deficiency, rather than the supplement making a difference for already healthy people. Another complication is the power of placebo. Of course, many studies, like that on garlic supplements, do control with a placebo-only group – so the effect for those isn’t down to placebo alone. But if we swear that something for which there’s limited or no scientific evidence, like chicken soup or orange juice, really cures us, it may be down to placebo. Placebos have been found to be effective in alleviating many symptoms, from pain to irritable bowel syndrome, although the reasons why aren’t yet fully understood. And whether for vitamin C or chicken soup, the placebo effect alone could help us get over a cold. One study found that people who believed in the alleged cold-fighting properties of herbal remedy echinacea experienced milder and shorter colds when taking daily doses, compared to than those who didn’t believe in it. Previous studies in which participants weren't aware they were getting echinacea weren't shown to improve cold symptoms. It works the other way, too. Milk has long been thought to worsen mucus production when we have a cold, although this has now been debunked. But one study found that people who believed that milk causes mucus reported more respiratory symptoms after drinking it. (Find out more in our BBC Future story Should you avoid dairy when you have a cold?). While placebos are usually administered by doctors in clinical trials, the placebo power of home remedies can come from our everyday lives, says Felicity\\xa0Bishop, associate professor of health psychology at the University of Southampton. “Studies show the power of the placebo pill comes from a trusted relationship between patients and healthcare professionals, someone who is caring and can offer treatments with confidence,” she says. “And this is kind of what parents do when we’re young. It’s the nature of the relationship is important, rather than who that person is.” As well as trusted friends and family, the placebo effect could also be strengthened by how foods are marketed, Bishop adds. The good news? Knowing that home remedies are placebos won’t necessarily stop them from alleviating our symptoms. “Open-label placebos, when a doctor tells the patient something is a placebo but that it’s helped some people, can still make patients better,” she says. Another effect could be the comfort induced by such foods. Dietician Sarah Schenker says the comfort of having chicken soup, for example, could help someone with a cold to feel slightly better. Rather than how much vitamin C we stock up on, the chances of being able to stave off bugs in winter depends largely on the individual – including how much we believe in placebos, but also because of our genes. “Some people’s genes make them particularly susceptible to certain diseases. It’s much more important to realise we all differ genetically from one another – when some people have the flu, they don’t realise they’ve got it, while others get a very serious disease. This is partly determined by your genes, which have much more of an impact.” For the majority of us with healthy immune systems, we can do little more than rely on the power of placebos to get over winter bugs… though popping some zinc or garlic supplements might help too.

       " 'People diet for many reasons, including to lose weight, gain muscle or improve sporting performance. The requirements of these diets can be worlds apart, but there’s one thing they often share: ‘cheat days’. A cheat day is a scheduled break in a diet. The concept emerged around the same time as ‘clean eating’, and is based on the idea that a dieter can ‘cheat’ for one day a week as long as they eat to their diet plan for the remaining six days. Social media has increased awareness of these days off, notably among those dieting to gain muscle. Instagram heavy-weight and former wrestler Dwayne ‘the Rock’ Johnson is well known for his cheat day posts. Once a week, he appears to eat whatever he wants – usually a lot of it – and he is not alone. A study published in the International Journal of Eating Disorders analysed a sample of 600 Instagram images from 1.6 million tagged with #cheatmeal. More than half of these contained “very large quantities of calorie-dense food”, providing an insight into the types of meals considered a cheat. Hamburgers, chips, pizzas and ice cream were commonly featured. The study also found #cheatmeal is often featured alongside muscular bodies. Two main motivations for #cheatmeals are identified. First is the theory that cheat days boost your metabolism, causing you to burn more calories. When you restrict your calorie intake, your body eventually adapts and resets your metabolism to your new lower intake, but the argument goes that cheat days reduce or prevent this. Second is the theory that cheat days help you stick to your diet. Your levels of leptin (the hormone responsible for suppressing feelings of hunger) fall when you diet, and this can make it harder to resist eating. The theory goes that cheat days help keep your leptin levels up. Both these ideas suggest that cheat meals should be planned into a diet rather than being a spur-of-the-moment thing. So could cheat days be good for your metablism? “There is no rigorous scientific research to support this”, says nutritionist Fiona Hunter. “From a physiological perspective, the argument one needs a cheat day is faulty”, says personal trainer Scott Laidler. “Someone who is following a meal plan or getting in shape for the first time shouldn’t be scheduling in huge meals.” Big cheat meals may not be a big deal for the Rock, as he is an ex-wrestler who has built up a diet and exercise routine over decades and is already in the shape he wants to be in. But that does not mean they’re not a big deal for the rest of us. A cheat meal can be more of a psychological tool than a physical one. “Put simply, it’s something to look forward to”, says Laidler. Can cheat days actually keep your levels of leptin up and therefore suppress your feelings of hunger? “Whether leptin has a role to play in controlling body weight is still a subject of debate among scientists, and the evidence that leptin actually increases after a cheat day is inconclusive”, says Hunter. Wanting a cheat day can also be a “reflection of a very restrictive and unenjoyable diet”, says Emma Randall, a mindful eating consultant. The more you restrict some foods, the more you’ll think about them. “Will-power is a bit like a phone battery; it tends to run out by the end of the day”, she says. Randall suggests a moderate weight-loss diet that doesn’t leave you craving cheat days is likely to be more beneficial for physical and mental health than a very restrictive diet with cheat days. Sports and eating disorder dietitian Renee McGregor says some cheat day enthusiasts undo the progress they have made by tucking into a cheat meal, while others feel anxious about their cheat meal and analyse it to “get it right”. But she adds that referring to any foods as a ‘cheat’ may cause anxiety, because of its negative connotations. One version of the ‘cheat day’ is the ‘treat day’, which sounds more positive, but it still alludes to some foods being good and others bad. “No one food is bad, it is how much and how often you eat it that counts”, says Randall. “Some foods are more nutritionally dense than others”, says McGregor, but food isn’t just good or bad, and needs to be “repackaged” to add other elements, such as enjoyment. A review suggests the most effective strategy for long-term weight-loss and heart health is a healthy dietary pattern that’s compatible with what you like to eat and your lifestyle. It’s about finding what works for you. Hunter agrees: “When I’m asked, ‘What’s the best type of diet to help you lose weight’, my reply is always the same: ‘the one you can stick to’. Cheat days can have a psychological effect, and it can be positive or negative – for some people it can be easier to stick with a restricted diet if you have a cheat day to look forward.” Laidler has seen how different plans can work for different people. “There are two types of people when it comes to dieting”, he says, “those who need to let off steam in exchange for the discipline, and those who feel a sense of achievement from adhering to a plan”. He says letting off steam through a cheat day can work, as long as your cheat diet is sensible and doesn’t include lots of high-calorie or unhealthy foods, such as those high in saturated fat, salt or sugar. However, many people go over the top on their cheat days, and this is unhealthy behaviour and some suggest this could increase the risk of eating disorders. So what if you’re trying to build muscle rather than lose weight? “You could argue cheat days are less likely to have a negative impact for body builders, because calories aren’t such an issue, but there is no evidence that they are suited to any type of diet”, says Hunter.

One version of the ‘cheat day’ is the ‘treat day’, which sounds more positive, but it still alludes to some foods being good and others bad. “No one food is bad, it is how much and how often you eat it that counts”, says Randall. “Some foods are more nutritionally dense than others”, says McGregor, but food isn’t just good or bad, and needs to be “repackaged” to add other elements, such as enjoyment. A review suggests the most effective strategy for long-term weight-loss and heart health is a healthy dietary pattern that’s compatible with what you like to eat and your lifestyle. It’s about finding what works for you. Hunter agrees: “When I’m asked, ‘What’s the best type of diet to help you lose weight’, my reply is always the same: ‘the one you can stick to’. Cheat days can have a psychological effect, and it can be positive or negative – for some people it can be easier to stick with a restricted diet if you have a cheat day to look forward.” Laidler has seen how different plans can work for different people. “There are two types of people when it comes to dieting”, he says, “those who need to let off steam in exchange for the discipline, and those who feel a sense of achievement from adhering to a plan”. He says letting off steam through a cheat day can work, as long as your cheat diet is sensible and doesn’t include lots of high-calorie or unhealthy foods, such as those high in saturated fat, salt or sugar. However, many people go over the top on their cheat days, and this is unhealthy behaviour and some suggest this could increase the risk of eating disorders. So what if you’re trying to build muscle rather than lose weight? “You could argue cheat days are less likely to have a negative impact for body builders, because calories aren’t such an issue, but there is no evidence that they are suited to any type of diet”, says Hunter.

       " 'Dr Charles Swanton\\'s days are busy, but the work is rewarding. The Francis Crick Institute, where he works, has been testing medics in London who were sent home after showing symptoms of Covid-19. Those found to be free of the virus are now back at their jobs. Overburdened hospitals have been desperate for more testing facilities like this to help medical staff return to work. The UK government set a target of 100,000 tests per day by the end of April, but has struggled to get near that number. A test to see if someone has the coronavirus is a complicated process (different tests, which see if someone has ever had the virus are still awaiting approval). Molecules on a swab are broken down into genetic code, using chemicals, liquid handling robots and a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) machine which can make billions of copies of DNA strands. Private and university laboratories across the UK have donated enough equipment for three huge testing centres in Glasgow, Milton Keynes and Alderley Park in Cheshire. But having the machines is not enough, they also need blended cocktails of chemicals to function. These secret recipes have been tested over time, verified by regulators and guarded by the companies that sell them. Like a cook with a ready-bake cake mix, scientists know all the ingredients, but the exact proportions are specific to each company. The firms that manufacture and sell them include Qiagen, Roche, Merck and Eurofins Genomics. Each have their own recipes, designed for specific models of the PCR machines. Dr Swanton and his colleagues at the Crick Institute realised that most of the world would be clamouring for these kits. They also knew the firms that manufactured them would be swamped. So rather than wait, they reverse engineered their own \"home-brew\" to test local medical staff in London, as a voluntary service. The Crick Institute is led by Nobel Prize-winning scientist, Sir Paul Nurse, but not run by the health services. It is a research lab formed from a partnership between Cancer Research UK, and London hospitals which include the Royal Marsden, Imperial College London, King\\'s College London and University College London. Three weeks ago, when the virus crept across Europe their labs were deemed non-essential and closed. They handed in much of their machinery to the Department of Health and Social Care which is leading the testing ramp-up, outside hospitals. Dr Swanton, at the time, worked as Cancer Research UK\\'s chief clinician, researching the way that cancer progresses. \"We were going to be sent home. I thought to myself, \\'Well there are a lot of non-essential workers I know who might actually be quite essential to the coronavirus effort,\\'\" he says. He sent an email round. A working group was formed. At the same time, Mr Nurse sent an email to his employees at the Crick Institute asking for possible volunteers for a lab. He received 300 replies in 24 hours. Clinicians including Dr Swanton, many from the University College London, and some at a private lab nearby in St Pancras called HSL (Health Service Laboratories), worked together to find a new procedure for making the chemical kits with the equipment that the government had left behind. Dr Swanton now leads the Covid-19 testing efforts at the Crick Institute. \"We have the staff here, the facilities, the resources, the reagents and the know-how to get on and just do it. And so that\\'s what we chose to do,\" says Dr Swanton. Their home-made chemical kit (an RNA extraction kit) has been approved through a rapid accreditation process and they have made their operating procedure public. The test for Covid-19 uses two stages of pre-packed chemical kits to extract the genetic material from the mucus and cells found on a skin swab. In this part of the test, the virus\\'s genetic code, its RNA, or ribonucleic acid, is found, cleaned and separated. Enzymes and other chemicals break up all of the cells that are sent in on the tip of the swab. Enzymes called proteases break up proteins in the sample. (Similar chemicals are added to laundry detergent to cut up the proteins in food stains.) Another set of chemicals stick the RNA to a membrane. And the reaction takes place in a liquid called a buffer. At this point, the RNA is still too small to be detected.  This is when the second chemical cocktail comes into play. This chemical cocktail allows the virus RNA code in the PCR machine to reproduce itself. Here the RNA is converted to a form of DNA, covered in fluorescent chemicals and copies are made until there are enough to detect. If enough bright spots show, the test indicates that the virus was present in the sample. The companies that are better known for making these chemical kits warn against reverse engineering them under the current circumstances. Dr Thomas Theuringer, a spokesperson for Qiagen, a German chemicals company that supplies reagents to the UK, says replacing these reagent cocktails with home-made recipes is \"playing with fire\". \"We can only guarantee that our extractions work if we make them in our production facilities where we have a controlled environment. Any mis-step and you might get a false positive and create more harm than good,\" he says. Several reagents produced by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the US failed to produce conclusive results. The CDC later admitted that kits had been \"rushed\". \"We are not talking about baking a cake - this is about life and death,\" says Dr Theuringer. The benefit of using commercial solutions, he says, is that Qiagen has been making them for a long time and that the standard operating procedures in their labs have been verified by several international health organisations. Roche, a company which also currently makes reagent kits for UK testing sites, agrees. \"The primary obstacles in another company or manufacturer producing any Roche test and reagents are time and expertise. Roche cannot guarantee safety and reliability if the reagents required for the test were manufactured outside our production network,\" a spokesman told the BBC in an email. Stanford University professor Eric Kool says: \"People have used home-brews for RNA extraction for a long time but for scaling up testing needs to be done in an automated fashion so that you can process many samples.\" Prof Kool teaches chemistry at Stanford, has his own RNA extraction kit business and offered to help the effort in the United States, but testing centres there told him his kits were not the right kind for the machines they had in place. \"Kind of like printer ink - you have to buy the right one for the printer,\" he says. \"These kits are all corporate secrets,\" he says, but adds that the automated kits have plug-ins which work best with the kind of 24-hour testing that needs to be done with Covid-19. \"Even while people are sleeping, the robots can be running samples,\" he says. This is the nub of the problem with large testing sites, like the ones built by the government. The PCR machines they have collected from labs across the UK will work best with the chemical kits which are in the shortest supply. The problem is worldwide, everyone is trying to get hold of the same automated RNA extraction kit. To add to the complexity, the companies that sell them have differing ideas on which buyers should take priority. This has been a difficult prospect for Qiagen, says its representative, Dr Theuringer, because his company has had to find a version of what fair allocation might be. \"No one company alone can help meet the demand,\" he says. It went from manufacturing 1.5 million kits a month to 20 million per month, hired new staff and moved from a three-shift day to working around the clock. Even so, they have been unable to meet demand, and even passed buyers on to their competitors. Roche says it remains committed to its partnership with the UK government. But its spokesman warns that \"due to the high demand on reagents and consumables the supply situation may be challenging in the short term in some cases\". Dr Swanton cannot tell whether making their own test kits for local NHS staff was the right decision. \"Only time will tell,\" he says, \"But we thought that doing nothing was not an option, really.\" President Trump holds his daily press briefing as US deaths from Covid-19 double in a week.',\n",

       " 'It looked like a golden roasted chicken drumstick. The smell wafting up from the plate in front of a dozen hungry senior citizens was of chicken too. When they dug in with their knives and forks, it even tasted loosely like one. Except that it was not chicken at all. What this group of elderly nursing home residents in Germany were tucking into was puree, printed into the shape of a drumstick. Each “chicken leg” – actually formed from vegetable paste shaped by a 3D printer and given a more pleasurable texture than ordinary puree – was tweaked to match the nutritional needs of the individual elderly diners. The group, who first ate this “not-chicken” meal in taste tests five years ago, were the participants of an innovative food project in Europe, named “Performance”, which explored whether 3D printed food could be delivered to elderly people with problems swallowing food, also known as dysphagia. For many people with chewing and swallowing issues eating a chicken drumstick would normally be difficult. Currently, however, most foods created for elderly people with this problem tend to be unappetising and boring, which can often lead to them not getting the nutrition they need. But a number of research teams are now developing solutions that might allow older people to still enjoy a nutritious, varied and interesting diet in a format which is easy to eat. To create their “chicken” dish, Biozoon, the company leading the 3D-printing project, first mixed fresh broccoli, cauliflower and potato puree with a variety of vitamins, calcium, carbohydrate and protein according to the needs of each diner. This mixture was then put into a 3D food printer, where it was mixed with a gelling agent to help the mixture solidify when printed into any shape they desired. The printed food was then frozen, to be reheated for serving. The project proved to be a success in terms of improving the appetite of those taking part, says Biozoon chief executive Matthias Kück. During the trial participants gained an average of 1.7kg (3.7lb) and over half of the respondents gave thumbs up to the texture of the 3D printed food. Their efforts are more important than you might think. More of us than ever before can expect to live to a ripe old age. By 2050, one in six people in the world will be over age 65, while one in four people living in Europe and Northern America could be aged 65 or over, according to figures released by the United Nations in 2019.\\xa0 The number of people aged 80 or over is estimated to triple from 143 million in 2019 to 426 million in 2050. And there could be as many as 3.7 million people over the age of 100 by 2050. With this “silver tsunami” set to hit nearly every country, creative food solutions are needed to ensure they get the healthy diets they need. Older people tend to experience more issues preventing them from eating the right diet. Dental problems as well as trouble swallowing can make eating difficult, while those with neurodegenerative conditions also struggle to get the right balance of food, according to a 2018 study in Hong Kong. One in three Chinese people aged 60 years and above have chewing difficulties, the study says. In Belgium alone, a study in 2009 found that over 70% of adults aged between 75 and 85 were identified with swallowing difficulties. Ageing also tends to blunt the sense of taste and smell due to a declining number of odour receptors in the nose. These issues in turn have a significant impact on nutritional status. \\xa0When coupled with other factors such as lower levels of exercise and the side effects of medication, many older people can suffer from malnutrition or obesity. Food consumption among the elderly can decline by as much as 25% in people aged 70 years and older while the proportion of malnourished adults in nursing homes, for example, can be as high as 60%. “Malnutrition is more frequent in the elderly that do exercise regularly, develop depressive disorders and have poor health,” says Mariane Lutz, a professor of human nutrition at the University of Valparaiso in Chile. Obesity is also becoming more prevalent among the elderly. Almost a fifth of people over the age of 50 in Europe were obese in 2015 while roughly 30% of people over the age of 60 in the US are classified as obese. A major part of the problem is that as we age we tend to change our diet, either through choice or because we are forced to. But the World Health Organization says although changes to the diet can alter the risk of disease through out a person’s life, it has a greater impact in older people. Reductions in saturated fat and salt intake, for example, can reduce blood pressure and cholesterol concentrations, as well as the burden of cardiovascular disease. An ideal diet for the elderly should be rich in proteins, vitamins – especially B complex and D which can increase bone and muscle strength – along with minerals, long-chain omega-three fatty acids and fibre, according to Lutz. An adequate supply of calcium can also help preserve bone and muscle mass, while they also require a high amount of energy derived from dietary protein, according to recent research conducted by Lutz. “A diet that includes plenty of plant-based foods – vegetables, legumes, cereals, nuts, seeds and fruits – is also a good source of phytochemicals (compounds that form part of a plant’s chemical defense system) that exert many beneficial effects, avoiding the need to use commercial dietary supplements,” she added. Fish and shellfish products are also highly recommended for better protein intake, Lutz adds. But in a strong body of research on the nutritional needs of the elderly, one European study found that one in five adults and people aged 64 or above don’t get enough vitamin D, folic acid, calcium, selenium and iodine. Serving them the same food you would serve younger adults is not the right approach, says Tanja Sobko, a food scientist at the University of Hong Kong. “The elderly eat much slower and a lot less, so the nutritional value of the food should be much higher,” she says. Pureed food has been a common solution, but the texture and appearance can often be off-putting. Many experts argue how food is represented is also important. Foods that are sticky and adhesive also require more effort for the elderly to eat. Biozoon’s Kück agrees that mashed food is not visually appealing and may play a role in the loss of appetite that many older people experience. In their project at the German nursing home, his team used red colouring to make the 3D printed food more stimulating. The colour of the food can enhance its visual appeal and warm colours work best, says Lutz. “Foods should be appealing in their representation, and a good combination of colours is fundamental,” she says. “Colour is a very important intrinsic sensory cue that drives our sensory and hedonic expectations towards the food to be consumed, by making predictions and judgements about their taste and flavour.” Biozoon are not the only ones to have tested concept of 3D food printing to cater for the old. Sweden’s research institute Rise, based in Gothenburg, \\xa0is also testing 3D-printed food in elderly care homes. \\xa0The project spans three locations – Halmstad and Helsingborg, and a company that offers catering to hospitals. “In Sweden, we recreate the purees into shape-stable products that can be cut, or picked up by hand, and are smooth and easy enough to swallow,” says Evelina Höglund, the project organiser. “It aims to make the meal looks more appealing and you can eat it with a knife and a fork.” The team use food purees of broccoli, chicken and bread to give a protein boost to their elderly diners. The printed food is then baked in the oven before being served to the participants. “We want the food for dysphagia to look just like normal food, so they know what they are eating,” says Höglund. “Achieving the same goal by hand is too time-consuming in a commercial kitchen. That’s why we want to 3D print it.” In Asia, a university in Singapore has attempted to recreate some of the country’s most popular foods and signature dishes as a sensory solution for older people. The joint project between Singapore Polytechnic’s Food Innovation and Resource Centre and SIT-Massey University used 3D printing to create a version of chicken rice for older people that was fortified with calcium, chicken and broccoli puree. The result was a ginger-yellow coloured drumstick, surrounded by white and green puree meticulously printed to resemble rice and broccoli. The team also created 3D printed durians – a large and hugely popular fruit in Asia – with reduced sugar, and a chilli crab dish intended to resemble the original in taste and texture. “We conducted consumer insight gathering in the initial phase of our research, to understand the needs of the silver-agers; specifically, foods that they love but restricted in consumption due to health concerns,” says Evelyn Ong, production innovation manager at Singapore Polytechnic’s Food Innovation and Resource Centre. But despite the excitement around projects like those in Germany, Singapore and Sweden, 3D food printing is still relatively early in development and some way from a viable commercial product. Biozoon’s Kück says they encountered difficulties ensuring the printed food had the same quality when using cauliflower puree, as printers perform differently in varying room temperatures, and it took too long to print all the meals. When feeding residents in a large nursing home, that could be a problem. The project has instead led to another company that is focused on 3D printing of chocolates instead. That’s nearly the only area where 3D food printing is finding success, according to Jeffrey Lipton, a mechanical engineer at the University of Washington focusing on soft robotics and 3D printing. The biggest hurdle facing the technology is its ability to produce foods on large scale and at speed. The number of edible materials that can be printed are also limited. “Not every food should or can be put into a 3D fabrication process,” he says. “For that, we need to interface with robotic cooking technology more broadly.” Fortunately there are other ways to improve the food for the senior generation. One study found that it can be as easy as adding monosodium glutamate, a flavour enhancer commonly-used in canned and processed food, to elderly people’s food to increase their salivary flow and improve their appetite. Other artificial flavourings including roast beef, bacon, cheese, fruits are also said to be able to increase the elderly person’s food intake. Manipulating food textures has also been found to be effective in helping the elderly with eating difficulties. Making foods softer, moister and in smaller portions can all help with this. The Irish Agricultural Development Agency, for example, has been experimenting with adding rice protein and lentil flour to beef patties in order to improve their texture. But sometimes simply getting to the food itself can be a challenge for the elderly. Operating a tin opener or twisting open a jar with arthritis, for example, can leave many older people unable to eat a wide range of food. There are attempts, however, to develop innovative food packaging tailor-made for older age groups . These include paper wrappers that can be easily torn but keep the food fresh. Others include orbit lids on jars, which have a separate outer ring that can be loosened more easily than a traditional lid. Vacuum skin packaging technology also allows food to be cooked, transported, reheated and served in one single package. “Food label texts should be reader-friendly, well distinguished from the background and use short texts,” adds Lutz. In Australia, government agencies and non-governmental organisations provide a rating on packaging accessibility, showing how easily products can be opened by older people. Their research showed more than 80% of elderly patients in hospitals in New South Wales experienced difficulties or unable to open food packaging items. Other tricks can also make a difference. In Sweden, some nursing homes bake cinnamon buns before mealtimes so the elderly can connect the smell with positive emotions. “It is a strong tradition in Swedish homes to bake cinnamon rolls – we do this for children and when we sell our houses,” says Sobko. “It brings back the good memories for the old people. It is difficult for them to feel hungry, but the pleasant smell can stimulate it. Coupled with milk, that is their childhood memory.” Join one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter orInstagram.

       " 'It looked like a golden roasted chicken drumstick. The smell wafting up from the plate in front of a dozen hungry senior citizens was of chicken too. When they dug in with their knives and forks, it even tasted loosely like one. Except that it was not chicken at all. What this group of elderly nursing home residents in Germany were tucking into was puree, printed into the shape of a drumstick. Each “chicken leg” – actually formed from vegetable paste shaped by a 3D printer and given a more pleasurable texture than ordinary puree – was tweaked to match the nutritional needs of the individual elderly diners. The group, who first ate this “not-chicken” meal in taste tests five years ago, were the participants of an innovative food project in Europe, named “Performance”, which explored whether 3D printed food could be delivered to elderly people with problems swallowing food, also known as dysphagia. For many people with chewing and swallowing issues eating a chicken drumstick would normally be difficult. Currently, however, most foods created for elderly people with this problem tend to be unappetising and boring, which can often lead to them not getting the nutrition they need. But a number of research teams are now developing solutions that might allow older people to still enjoy a nutritious, varied and interesting diet in a format which is easy to eat. To create their “chicken” dish, Biozoon, the company leading the 3D-printing project, first mixed fresh broccoli, cauliflower and potato puree with a variety of vitamins, calcium, carbohydrate and protein according to the needs of each diner. This mixture was then put into a 3D food printer, where it was mixed with a gelling agent to help the mixture solidify when printed into any shape they desired. The printed food was then frozen, to be reheated for serving. The project proved to be a success in terms of improving the appetite of those taking part, says Biozoon chief executive Matthias Kück. During the trial participants gained an average of 1.7kg (3.7lb) and over half of the respondents gave thumbs up to the texture of the 3D printed food. Their efforts are more important than you might think. More of us than ever before can expect to live to a ripe old age. By 2050, one in six people in the world will be over age 65, while one in four people living in Europe and Northern America could be aged 65 or over, according to figures released by the United Nations in 2019.\\xa0 The number of people aged 80 or over is estimated to triple from 143 million in 2019 to 426 million in 2050. And there could be as many as 3.7 million people over the age of 100 by 2050. With this “silver tsunami” set to hit nearly every country, creative food solutions are needed to ensure they get the healthy diets they need. Older people tend to experience more issues preventing them from eating the right diet. Dental problems as well as trouble swallowing can make eating difficult, while those with neurodegenerative conditions also struggle to get the right balance of food, according to a 2018 study in Hong Kong. One in three Chinese people aged 60 years and above have chewing difficulties, the study says. In Belgium alone, a study in 2009 found that over 70% of adults aged between 75 and 85 were identified with swallowing difficulties. Ageing also tends to blunt the sense of taste and smell due to a declining number of odour receptors in the nose. These issues in turn have a significant impact on nutritional status. \\xa0When coupled with other factors such as lower levels of exercise and the side effects of medication, many older people can suffer from malnutrition or obesity. Food consumption among the elderly can decline by as much as 25% in people aged 70 years and older while the proportion of malnourished adults in nursing homes, for example, can be as high as 60%. “Malnutrition is more frequent in the elderly that do exercise regularly, develop depressive disorders and have poor health,” says Mariane Lutz, a professor of human nutrition at the University of Valparaiso in Chile. Obesity is also becoming more prevalent among the elderly. Almost a fifth of people over the age of 50 in Europe were obese in 2015 while roughly 30% of people over the age of 60 in the US are classified as obese. A major part of the problem is that as we age we tend to change our diet, either through choice or because we are forced to. But the World Health Organization says although changes to the diet can alter the risk of disease through out a person’s life, it has a greater impact in older people. Reductions in saturated fat and salt intake, for example, can reduce blood pressure and cholesterol concentrations, as well as the burden of cardiovascular disease. An ideal diet for the elderly should be rich in proteins, vitamins – especially B complex and D which can increase bone and muscle strength – along with minerals, long-chain omega-three fatty acids and fibre, according to Lutz. An adequate supply of calcium can also help preserve bone and muscle mass, while they also require a high amount of energy derived from dietary protein, according to recent research conducted by Lutz. “A diet that includes plenty of plant-based foods – vegetables, legumes, cereals, nuts, seeds and fruits – is also a good source of phytochemicals (compounds that form part of a plant’s chemical defense system) that exert many beneficial effects, avoiding the need to use commercial dietary supplements,” she added. Fish and shellfish products are also highly recommended for better protein intake, Lutz adds. But in a strong body of research on the nutritional needs of the elderly, one European study found that one in five adults and people aged 64 or above don’t get enough vitamin D, folic acid, calcium, selenium and iodine. Serving them the same food you would serve younger adults is not the right approach, says Tanja Sobko, a food scientist at the University of Hong Kong. “The elderly eat much slower and a lot less, so the nutritional value of the food should be much higher,” she says. Pureed food has been a common solution, but the texture and appearance can often be off-putting. Many experts argue how food is represented is also important. Foods that are sticky and adhesive also require more effort for the elderly to eat. Biozoon’s Kück agrees that mashed food is not visually appealing and may play a role in the loss of appetite that many older people experience. In their project at the German nursing home, his team used red colouring to make the 3D printed food more stimulating. The colour of the food can enhance its visual appeal and warm colours work best, says Lutz. “Foods should be appealing in their representation, and a good combination of colours is fundamental,” she says. “Colour is a very important intrinsic sensory cue that drives our sensory and hedonic expectations towards the food to be consumed, by making predictions and judgements about their taste and flavour.” Biozoon are not the only ones to have tested concept of 3D food printing to cater for the old. Sweden’s research institute Rise, based in Gothenburg, \\xa0is also testing 3D-printed food in elderly care homes. \\xa0The project spans three locations – Halmstad and Helsingborg, and a company that offers catering to hospitals. “In Sweden, we recreate the purees into shape-stable products that can be cut, or picked up by hand, and are smooth and easy enough to swallow,” says Evelina Höglund, the project organiser. “It aims to make the meal looks more appealing and you can eat it with a knife and a fork.” The team use food purees of broccoli, chicken and bread to give a protein boost to their elderly diners. The printed food is then baked in the oven before being served to the participants. “We want the food for dysphagia to look just like normal food, so they know what they are eating,” says Höglund. “Achieving the same goal by hand is too time-consuming in a commercial kitchen. That’s why we want to 3D print it.” In Asia, a university in Singapore has attempted to recreate some of the country’s most popular foods and signature dishes as a sensory solution for older people. The joint project between Singapore Polytechnic’s Food Innovation and Resource Centre and SIT-Massey University used 3D printing to create a version of chicken rice for older people that was fortified with calcium, chicken and broccoli puree. The result was a ginger-yellow coloured drumstick, surrounded by white and green puree meticulously printed to resemble rice and broccoli. The team also created 3D printed durians – a large and hugely popular fruit in Asia – with reduced sugar, and a chilli crab dish intended to resemble the original in taste and texture. “We conducted consumer insight gathering in the initial phase of our research, to understand the needs of the silver-agers; specifically, foods that they love but restricted in consumption due to health concerns,” says Evelyn Ong, production innovation manager at Singapore Polytechnic’s Food Innovation and Resource Centre. But despite the excitement around projects like those in Germany, Singapore and Sweden, 3D food printing is still relatively early in development and some way from a viable commercial product. Biozoon’s Kück says they encountered difficulties ensuring the printed food had the same quality when using cauliflower puree, as printers perform differently in varying room temperatures, and it took too long to print all the meals. When feeding residents in a large nursing home, that could be a problem. The project has instead led to another company that is focused on 3D printing of chocolates instead. That’s nearly the only area where 3D food printing is finding success, according to Jeffrey Lipton, a mechanical engineer at the University of Washington focusing on soft robotics and 3D printing. The biggest hurdle facing the technology is its ability to produce foods on large scale and at speed. The number of edible materials that can be printed are also limited. “Not every food should or can be put into a 3D fabrication process,” he says. “For that, we need to interface with robotic cooking technology more broadly.” Fortunately there are other ways to improve the food for the senior generation.

       " 'The BBC\\'s weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to UK-based Serbian fashion designer Roksanda Ilincic. I should be speaking to Roksanda at her east London studio, surrounded by the unusual, colourful clothes that made her name. But the coronavirus pandemic means we\\'ve had to relegate our interview to a chat over the phone, where her passion for design still shines through, alongside her distress at the current situation. \"It\\'s a very sad and challenging time,\" she says. \"We are questioning everything - how we and our families are going to survive, and our businesses as well. \\'\\'Sadly, this time is the biggest low in my career, and I just hope together we are going to find some answers.\" So, how does one lead a team of 35 while designing from home? With difficulty, Roksanda says. \"It\\'s not easy, because in design lots of things are done in 3D, so you have to assess things on a model, and see how they look in each direction - it\\'s very tactile.\" The UK has been the Serbian designer\\'s home for more than two decades, after she enrolled on a masters degree in fashion at the prestigious Central Saint Martins college in London. Born and raised in Serbia, she knew just one person in London when she started in her early 20s. Despite her \"zero\" fashion contacts, Roksanda\\'s self-titled designs have become the go-to look for some of the world\\'s most famous women. Michelle Obama and Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, are long-term supporters of her brand. While Meghan Markle wore one of her designs on her 2018 tour of Australia with Prince Harry.  It promptly sold out, prompting a host of High Street lookalike versions. \\'\\'When you see how many different women - the Duchess of Cambridge, but also other incredible women - wear me, I am very proud I can appeal to women who are diverse, not just in personality, but in body shape and style,\\'\\' the designer says. Accordingly, Roksanda has collaborated on a plus size collection, and says she is more inspired by her mum and her daughter than by her famous fans. When discussions turn to getting the UK moving again, post coronavirus, the fashion industry may not be top of the list. Yet the sector is worth £32bn to the British economy and employs almost 900,000 people. That\\'s a bigger workforce than the car industry, as Roksanda points out. And fashion isn\\'t the bubble that some would have us believe, she says. Look at Christian Dior, whose feminine, opulent designs at the end of World War Two were a direct reaction to the drab, utilitarian clothing worn during the conflict. \"Clothes are worn to protect us, like a uniform. But fashion is something very different. It is a mirror of society and what\\'s going on,\" says Roksanda. \"In hard times, some people want to retreat and go to the basics, while others want to dream and escape. Fashion tackles and answers both of those needs.\" Roksanda\\'s work has always been a reflection of her wider preoccupations, all the way back to her Saint Martins studies, where \"terrible homesickness\" for Serbia inspired her designs. \\'\\'The colours that I\\'m so well known by came out of nostalgia for my country. Back home we have wonderful strong suns, and colours bursting from nature, and I wanted to brings those elements in to my work, to remind me what I\\'m missing,\\'\\' she explains. Despite this pining - and the fashion world\\'s frosty reputation - Roksanda says she was welcomed in London, a city of \"endless possibility\". After graduating from Saint Martins, she was given financial support from the British Fashion Council\\'s \"NewGen\" scheme. Sponsored by fashion store chain Topshop, it backs new designers. Then in 2005, Roksanda made her London Fashion Week debut, showcasing 11 dresses. Her reputation and sales grew from there. Today, like her Saint Martin\\'s peer Stella McCartney, Roksanda has become synonymous with British fashion industry, and she now helps to campaign for more British exports. Her status was cemented earlier this year when she hosted her 2020 London Fashion Week show in the grand surroundings of the UK government\\'s Foreign and Commonwealth Office, looked on by stars such as actors Cate Blanchett and Vanessa Redgrave. Roksanda\\'s brand has \"a real signature look, which helps it to stand out in a crowded market,\\'\\' says Chana Baram, senior retail analyst at market research group Mintel. Regarding the wider luxury fashion sector, Ms Baram says it had been performing far better than the mainstream clothing, footwear and accessories market over the past few years. However, she warns that the large-scale shut down of Italy and China will be a huge blow to the high end fashion industry this year. \"Luxury industries, and all fashion sectors, are going to take a big hit in 2020,\" says Ms Baram. \"For smaller brands it might be really tough going, but they will hopefully be able to pull through and see success in 2021.\" Back at Roksanda\\'s studio, she says that if you want to be successful in business, or whatever else you want to do well in, you have to dedicate your life to it. \"There is this myth, when you look at somebody successful, that you think it happened quick, or it was effortless,\" she says. \"But with every win comes many losses, and you have to sacrifice things to gain something. It\\'s important to have passion, belief and patience for something you really want to do, and not to expect things to happen overnight.\" The education secretary also says he is sorry young people are having their schooling disrupted.',\n",

Look at Christian Dior, whose feminine, opulent designs at the end of World War Two were a direct reaction to the drab, utilitarian clothing worn during the conflict. \"Clothes are worn to protect us, like a uniform. But fashion is something very different. It is a mirror of society and what\\'s going on,\" says Roksanda. \"In hard times, some people want to retreat and go to the basics, while others want to dream and escape. Fashion tackles and answers both of those needs.\" Roksanda\\'s work has always been a reflection of her wider preoccupations, all the way back to her Saint Martins studies, where \"terrible homesickness\" for Serbia inspired her designs. \\'\\'The colours that I\\'m so well known by came out of nostalgia for my country. Back home we have wonderful strong suns, and colours bursting from nature, and I wanted to brings those elements in to my work, to remind me what I\\'m missing,\\'\\' she explains. Despite this pining - and the fashion world\\'s frosty reputation - Roksanda says she was welcomed in London, a city of \"endless possibility\". After graduating from Saint Martins, she was given financial support from the British Fashion Council\\'s \"NewGen\" scheme. Sponsored by fashion store chain Topshop, it backs new designers. Then in 2005, Roksanda made her London Fashion Week debut, showcasing 11 dresses. Her reputation and sales grew from there. Today, like her Saint Martin\\'s peer Stella McCartney, Roksanda has become synonymous with British fashion industry, and she now helps to campaign for more British exports. Her status was cemented earlier this year when she hosted her 2020 London Fashion Week show in the grand surroundings of the UK government\\'s Foreign and Commonwealth Office, looked on by stars such as actors Cate Blanchett and Vanessa Redgrave. Roksanda\\'s brand has \"a real signature look, which helps it to stand out in a crowded market,\\'\\' says Chana Baram, senior retail analyst at market research group Mintel. Regarding the wider luxury fashion sector, Ms Baram says it had been performing far better than the mainstream clothing, footwear and accessories market over the past few years. However, she warns that the large-scale shut down of Italy and China will be a huge blow to the high end fashion industry this year. \"Luxury industries, and all fashion sectors, are going to take a big hit in 2020,\" says Ms Baram. \"For smaller brands it might be really tough going, but they will hopefully be able to pull through and see success in 2021.\" Back at Roksanda\\'s studio, she says that if you want to be successful in business, or whatever else you want to do well in, you have to dedicate your life to it. \"There is this myth, when you look at somebody successful, that you think it happened quick, or it was effortless,\" she says. \"But with every win comes many losses, and you have to sacrifice things to gain something. It\\'s important to have passion, belief and patience for something you really want to do, and not to expect things to happen overnight.\" The education secretary also says he is sorry young people are having their schooling disrupted.',\n",
       " 'Lockdowns have been essential for containing the spread of coronavirus, but they are causing huge disruption, and distress, to lives around the world. There are big decisions for governments to make - when to act, which restrictions to lift, how to contain the virus instead and how to balance saving lives today with long-term damage to society. This is going to be a long journey - don\\'t think it will all be over in a few weeks. \"Essentially we\\'ve got a lot of not very good options, it won\\'t be one day and everything will change, but things could open up,\" Dr Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC. We cannot simply return to normal after cases peak or even after they are reduced to very low levels. The best estimate of the proportion of people infected (and potentially immune) in the UK is just 4%. Or to put that another way - more than 63 million are still vulnerable to the infection. If we just lift the lockdown, then another explosive outbreak is inevitable. The fundamentals of the virus have not changed either - one person infected will, without a lockdown, pass it onto three others on average. Cutting those infections by 60-70% is what it takes to keep cases down. At the moment that means cutting our human contact by that amount. If we lift social distancing measures then something else has to come in to suppress the virus instead or at least to prevent people ending up in intensive care. There may be some easy wins if countries are already cutting infections by more than 70%. \"There is evidence that a lot of countries in lockdown have gone beyond that, in China it is 80-90%,\" said Dr Kucharski. A high number now is good for bringing cases down quickly. But it is also an opportunity to lift some of the current restrictions without leading to a spike in cases. China, particularly in the original epicentre of the pandemic - Wuhan, had a tough and lengthy lockdown that including shutting down public transport. It is not yet clear how much wiggle room other countries may or may not have. Massively increasing testing for the virus allows for a strategy called \"seek and destroy\". You identify cases. Test anybody they came into contact with. And isolate them before they become infectious. It is remarkably similar to the approach taken at the start of the outbreak when there were relatively few imported cases being hunted down. Do this successfully enough and it will reduce the ability of the virus to spread and will mean we do not need as tough a set of restrictions on day-to-day life. \"At the moment you need, on average, a 60-70% reduction in social interactions to stop the outbreak increasing,\" said Dr Kucharski. \"If we can get that down to 30% that gives you a lot more to play with.\" But even massive testing is not life as normal. You would need other measures to keep the disease in check and these would have to be maintained in the long-term as the fundamentals (a virus that spreads and a vulnerable population) would not change. \"It is a more moderate version of where we are now,\" said Dr Kucharski. It is also intensive work that has to be done quickly in order to stay ahead of the infection (this is where talk of a smartphone app comes in to identify cases) and the method is most viable when cases are at low levels. Another strategy is called \"enhanced shielding\". Instead of trying to suppress the coronavirus across every section of society you could instead aim to stop it completely for those most at risk. Age and other medical conditions greatly increase the risk of Covid-19 becoming fatal. The lockdown is preventing intensive care units being overwhelmed, but guaranteeing vulnerable groups don\\'t get infected could achieve the same aim even if cases were spreading more widely in the young and the healthy. Prof Mark Woolhouse, from the University of Edinburgh, said: \"Very crudely, for 80% of us who are not vulnerable this is a nasty virus, it\\'s certainly a significant health problem, but it wouldn\\'t overwhelm the healthcare system and it wouldn\\'t lock down society. \"If we really bolster that shielding, make a very strong shield indeed, then it buys you a lot more room and it may mean you can relax some measures permanently.\" We are already shielding the vulnerable and asking them to stay at home for 12 weeks. Enhancing that could mean all staff in hospitals, care homes or anyone visiting the elderly having regular testing to ensure they are clear of the virus. Ideally antibody tests would prove they are immune to it. The danger is, having more virus circulating in the community could be harder to control and then those \"shields\" will come under intense pressure. Some restrictions have less of an effect on the virus than others. \"There are certain interactions and activities that are overall less risky,\" said Dr Kucharski. He argues lifting different restrictions can be put into three broad categories - those with low, moderate and substantial risk of increasing transmission of the virus. Low risk includes exercising outdoors, which has been restricted in some countries. Moderate would include letting some non-essential shops re-open or having occasional gatherings with people outside the household. Substantial increases could come from lifting advice to work from home, reopening schools or isolating sick people and quarantining households. \"I think the order things went in will be reflected in the order things will be lifted,\" he says. But which measures to lift will be a difficult balancing act. It will have to be a combination of the benefits to society and the economy against the impact on the spread of the virus. Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, said: \"We do want to find a collection of policies that maintain suppression of this virus. \"Without doubt, measures will be targeted probably by age, by geography and we will need to introduce in my view larger levels of testing at the community level to really isolate cases more effectively and identify where transmission is happening.\" The idea of immunity passports or certificates is constantly doing the rounds - if you\\'ve had the disease you have a test and if you have antibodies that can kill the virus then you can go about your daily life. However, there are a number of scientific challenges. We don\\'t have an accurate antibody test. We don\\'t know how long immunity might last. And we don\\'t know that even if antibodies stop you from becoming ill whether they are enough to stop you harbouring the virus and spreading it to others. Prof Ferguson has suggested measures could begin to be lifted by the end of May. But there is also a decision about how far we go with suppressing the virus after we\\'ve gone past the peak. We could drive levels down as low as possible and that will greatly limit the ability of the virus to bounce back in a second wave. But the trade off is maintaining the lockdown for longer. Or we could exit lockdown earlier and accept having a higher number of cases bubbling away, which creates its own problems. There is also a decision over whether to maintain a UK-wide approach to lifting lockdown or whether measures could vary regionally, or even within cities, to focus on where outbreaks are happening. The biggest thing that could come along is a vaccine - if people were immunised then there would be no need for any social distancing measures. That is thought to be more than a year away. If a vaccine does not come along (people are hopeful, but it is requiring development at unprecedented speed) then the concept of herd immunity may kick in. This would happen when so many people had been infected (up to 70% of the population) that the virus can no longer cause large outbreaks. Effective drugs would also make a huge difference. If they could stop Covid-19 from progressing from a cough or fever into a serious disease needing intensive care then having large numbers of cases would be less of a problem. Again we are waiting for the results of clinical trials. We might get closer to normality, or at least normality for some, in the months to come. But we are all still in this for the long haul.

       " 'Conservation groups say nature must be a cornerstone of economic recovery plans for the sake of people, health and economies. The call comes amid fears of a \"spike in poaching\" as rural communities lose vital income. In Cambodia, 1% of the entire population of one critically endangered bird was wiped out in a single event. The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) said three of only a few hundred remaining giant ibis were poisoned. And more than 100 painted stork chicks were killed at Cambodia\\'s Prek Toal Ramsar Site, the largest water bird colony in Southeast Asia. Conservationists are noticing increases in hunting of protected species since the spread of coronavirus began to disrupt traditional economic and social systems in rural areas, said the WCS. \"Suddenly rural people have little to turn to but natural resources and we\\'re already seeing a spike in poaching,\" said Colin Poole, WCS regional director in Phnom Penh. Conservation organisations need to be doing their utmost to support local people, he said. \"They\\'re the last line of defence for these forests, these birds, these wetlands, and they\\'re the people that need support right now so they have alternatives and they don\\'t need to turn to natural resource extraction to survive.\" In India, there have been reports of an upsurge in tiger poaching, while there are fears in Africa that the rhinoceros and other endangered species could be at risk. Matt Brown, director of the Africa region for the Nature Conservancy, spoke of a sudden decline in tourism revenue at some of Africa\\'s key wildlife reserves and national parks as a result of the pandemic. \"The concern is how do these areas maintain the effectiveness of their wildlife patrolling and security when about 50% of their planned revenue for the year has now dropped to zero,\" he said. And the closing of export businesses and manufacturing plants had put a lot of people out of work, which on top of the tourism drop was \"a double whammy\". \"There could be an increased direct poaching pressure on wildlife as a result of the downturn in the global economy,\" he said. Finance ministers from G20 countries are meeting this week to discuss economic recovery plans to address the impacts of the pandemic. Conservation group Campaign for Nature, which includes experts from Asia, Africa and Latin America, is calling on ministers to include protection of nature in their plans. Hugo van der Westhuizen, of the Frankfurt Zoological Society, said now more than ever was the time to re-evaluate the value of nature. \"Conservation cannot be built and maintained only on tourism income or donor funding,\" he said. \"Covid-19 is teaching us that we take nature for granted, together with clean water and air, and it seems we need to lose something before we realise its value. Nature cannot be recreated once it is gone.\" Follow Helen on Twitter. President Trump holds his daily press briefing as US deaths from Covid-19 double in a week.',\n",
       " 'Measles outbreaks may occur as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, officials say, because some vaccination programmes are having to be delayed. Unicef says 117 million children in 37 countries may not get immunised on time. There have been several large outbreaks in countries across Europe where MMR vaccine uptake has been low. The UK has already lost its measles-free status, because of rising cases of the potentially deadly infection. The disease, which causes coughing, rashes and fever, can be prevented by two doses of the mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine, available free to all young children in the UK. Here, 95% of five-year-olds have had the first jab - the World Health Organization (WHO) target  - but only 87.4% have had the second. And as measles is highly infectious, even small declines in uptake can have an impact. The WHO says countries with no active outbreak of measles can temporarily pause their immunisation campaigns if necessary. But Unicef says even more may face disruptions. Spokeswoman Joanna Rea added: \"Disruptions to routine vaccine services will increase the risk of children contracting deadly diseases, compound the current pressures on the national health services and risks a second pandemic of infectious diseases.\" The UK continues to offer children MMR as part of its routine immunisation schedule. Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisations at Public Health England, said: \"The national immunisation programme is highly successful in preventing serious and sometimes life-threatening diseases, such as pneumonia, meningitis, whooping cough, diphtheria and measles. \"During this time, it is important to maintain the best possible vaccine uptake to prevent a resurgence of these infections.\" President Trump holds his daily press briefing as US deaths from Covid-19 double in a week.',\n",
       " 'Researchers say the economic costs of a deadly pathogen affecting olive trees in Europe could run to over €20 billion. They\\'ve modelled the future worst impacts of the Xylella fastidiosa pathogen which has killed swathes of trees in Italy. Spread by insects, the bacterium now poses a potential threat to olive plantations in Spain and Greece. The disease could increase the costs of olive oil for consumers. Xylella is considered to be one of the most dangerous pathogens for plants anywhere in the world. At present there is no cure for the infection. It can infect cherry, almond and plum trees as well as olives. It has become closely associated with olives after a strain was discovered in trees in Puglia in Italy in 2013. The organism is transmitted by sap-sucking insects such as spittlebugs. The infection limits the tree\\'s ability to move water and nutrients and over time it withers and dies. In Italy, the consequences of the spread of the disease have been devastating, with an estimated 60% decline in crop yields since the first discovery in 2013. \"The damage to the olives also causes a depreciation of the value of the land, and to the touristic attractiveness of this region,\" said Dr Maria Saponari, from the CNR Institute for Sustainable Plant Protection in Italy. \"It\\'s had a severe impact on the local economy and jobs connected with agriculture.\" As well as in Italy, the Xylella bacterium has now been found in Spain, France and Portugal. Tackling it at present involves removing infected trees and trying to clamp down on the movement of plant material and the insects that spread the disease. In this new study, researchers modelled different scenarios including what would happen if all growing ceased due to tree death. They also compared this worst case with a scenario where replanting with resistant varieties occurred. The team made projections for Italy, Spain and Greece, which between them account for 95% of European olive oil production. In Spain, if the infection expanded and the majority of trees became infected and died, the costs could run to €17 billion over the next 50 years. A similar scenario in Italy would amount to over five billion, while in Greece, the losses would be under two billion. If the rate of infection is slowed down, or resistant varieties are planted instead, then these costs would be significantly reduced. However, the authors believe, whatever happens, there will likely be a knock-on impact on consumers. \"The expected effect could be that there would be a shortage of supply,\" said lead author Kevin Schneider from Wageningen University in the Netherlands. \"And I would expect that if prices go up, consumers will be worse off.\" The authors say that while their analysis looks at economics, there are also potentially large touristic and cultural losses caused by the bacterium that can\\'t be ignored. \"You really hear devastating stories of infected orchards that were inherited over generations,\" said Dr Schneider. \"It\\'s the same orchard that their grandparents were once working on. So how do you put an economic number on the loss of something like this. The cultural heritage value would be far larger than we could compute.\" There are a growing number of scientific initiatives to try and take the fight to the bacterium, including using insect repelling clays, vegetative barriers and genetic analysis to determine why some plants are more susceptible to the infection than others. Ultimately, the researchers believe that beating the pathogen will require trees that are resistant to the disease. \"Sustainable strategies to reduce the population of the insects is the other pillar for the control of the vector-borne disease, in this regard, mechanical intervention to remove weeds in spring is one of the most efficacious applications to reduce the populations of the insect, indeed several other strategies are also being studied to implement the control of the insects,\" she added. While two varieties of olive tree have been found to have some resistance, the authors are calling for research in this area to be significantly boosted. The study has been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). Follow Matt on Twitter.

       " 'Personal protective equipment (PPE) - masks, gloves and other clothing to stop the spread of coronavirus - saves lives. NHS staff in hospitals and the community need it to be able to do their jobs safely. The government says it\\'s working \"around the clock\" to provide protective equipment, but there have been concerns that supplies of items like gowns are not reaching staff. NHS staff have been advised by the Department of Health and Social Care to consider reusing some PPE. Anyone who comes into close contact with patients who may or do have coronavirus should wear some form of protection. That includes staff working in care homes, prisons and other community settings as well as in GP surgeries or hospitals. The type of PPE required depends on the level of risk. Guidelines recommend that anyone working within 2m (6ft) of a confirmed or suspected Covid-19 patient should wear an apron, gloves, a surgical mask and eye protection. Clinicians carrying out tasks that could generate airborne droplets of saliva loaded with the virus should use an even higher standard of protection, including disposable gowns, filtering respirators and face-shielding visors. For example, that would include intensive care doctors getting a patient ready to go on a ventilator to support their breathing. The ambulance driver does not need to wear any PPE, but the rest of the crew should wear the appropriate amount depending on the likely level of exposure and risk they face. Pharmacy staff who cannot keep 2m away from possible patients should wear a surgical mask. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that by the weekend of 18 and 19 April, one billion items of PPE would have been delivered in the UK. The Department of Health and Social Care told BBC News on Sunday that between 25 February and 18 April there had been approximately 875 million items of PPE delivered to NHS Trusts and into social care systems in England. It added that tens of millions of pieces had been distributed by devolved administrations in the rest of the UK. Other equipment delivered included body bags, pulse oximeters, swabs, clinical waste containers, cleaning equipment and detergent. This is the vital question that is difficult to answer. There are around 1.58 million NHS staff across the UK in hospitals and the community. All of them will require varying amounts of PPE depending on the type of work they are doing. Some bits of kit can only be used once per patient, while others can be used for whole sessions, such as during a ward round visit to many patients. All PPE worn during the highest risk situations - where there will be lots of splatter from infectious droplets - should be single use, unless they can be decontaminated. Gowns, aprons, gloves and surgical masks should usually be disposed of after a single use or session. However, when there are shortages, guidelines now say NHS staff can reuse some kit where it is safe to do so, even if it is labelled as single use by the manufacturer. The Health and Safety Executive says it recognises \"some compromise\" is needed when there are extreme shortages of kit and that these \"exceptional circumstances\" do not reflect its standard approach. For example, some gowns could be washed by the hospital laundry and reused, it says. It is easy to see how a member of staff would need to use lots of PPE when following the guidelines. NHS Providers, whose members include health trusts, has thanked the fire and police services, vets, local councils, DIY stores and builders\\' merchants that have donated stocks of gowns and alternatives such as coveralls. On 19 April, the chief executive of NHS Providers Chris Hopson, said: \"No-one in the NHS wanted to be where we now are on gowns, with a significant number of trusts reporting critically low stocks.\" The government acknowledges it will require a \"Herculean logistical effort\" to get the right PPE to those who need it. Global demand for this equipment is at unprecedented levels and several countries have placed export bans on the sale of PPE. Ministers have recruited UK companies, like Burberry, to turn over production lines and start making PPE. Deliveries of kit will now happen every day, rather than every few days, says the government. There is a hotline that NHS and social care workers can call to request PPE. The British Medical Association, which represents doctors in the UK, criticised the advice that some single-use PPE could be reused. \"If it\\'s being proposed that staff reuse equipment, this must be demonstrably driven by science and the best evidence - rather than availability - and it absolutely cannot compromise the protection of healthcare workers,\" said Dr Rob Harwood, chair of its consultants committee. A BMA survey published on 18 April found that half of doctors working in high-risk areas reported shortages of long-sleeved disposable gowns and goggles. The Royal College of Nursing says its members can refuse to treat patients as a \"last resort\" if adequate PPE has not been provided.

       " 'From conspiracy theories linking 5G networks to the coronavirus, to misleading advice about the best way to battle Covid-19, social media sites have been awash with misinformation again. On the Tech Tent podcast this week, we look at the pressure on the likes of Facebook, WhatsApp and YouTube to do more to stem the flow of falsehoods. At first it seemed we could laugh off or ignore some of the outlandish falsehoods about the coronavirus spreading across the internet: that it did not exist; that it was engineered in a lab in China, or perhaps the United States; that it was all part of a plan by Bill Gates to insert microchips in our brains to control us. But it has become clear such misinformation can have damaging effects. Researchers at King\\'s College London questioned people about Covid-19 conspiracy theories, such as the false idea the virus was linked to the rollout of 5G mobile phone networks. And they found those who believed them were less likely to believe there was a good reason for the lockdown in the UK, with potentially damaging effects on health if they chose to ignore government instructions. In the past week, there have also been arson attacks on phone masts, apparently inspired by the conspiracy theories. Campaigns against 5G have been around for a while, with plenty of Facebook groups in the UK lobbying local councils to ban the new networks on health grounds, despite a lack of evidence they could cause harm. Then in late January, the idea 5G might be linked to the coronavirus started popping up on some of these groups. The idea was even featured in a couple of newspaper articles. While the social networks have previously been content to allow misinformation about 5G or vaccines or various conspiracy theories, this week they began to act. WhatsApp made it harder to forward all kinds of stories, while YouTube brought in a policy of deleting video linking symptoms of Covid-19 to 5G. Among the first videos to be taken down was a lengthy interview with the conspiracy theorist David Icke. Emily Bell, director of the Tow Centre for Digital Journalism, at New York\\'s Columbia University, tells Tech Tent there is a good reason the companies have taken a harder line. \"The pressure has been intense, not least because this is much more directly correlated to outcomes which affect life and death,\" she says. \"If people don\\'t take the science seriously, if they don\\'t do what they\\'re being asked to do in terms of social distancing, then people die.\" In the past, Facebook has come under fire from American conservatives for alleged bias when it has moved to ban people or limit the spread of misinformation. But for now, while a few free-speech advocates are pushing back against the crackdown on the conspiracy theorists, the social media companies are facing far less opposition than when they have silenced figures from the extreme right. A far bigger problem, as Emily Bell points out, is dealing with the sheer volume of misinformation about the virus flowing across the various platforms. \"What I hear from all of them is that they still don\\'t really have the internal mechanisms to deal with the tsunami of false information that they\\'re currently seeing,\" she says. The other question is whether it is ever possible to change the minds of people convinced 5G caused the coronavirus, or vaccines are deadly, or Apollo 11 never landed on the Moon. Some argue that rather than banning such material, the answer is to provide rigorous fact-checking and detailed scientific information. But, having spent far too much time in recent weeks lurking in various conspiratorial Facebook groups, I am not so sure. A member of one such group posted a message explaining how to type in the words \"fact check\" and \"fact checker\" into Facebook\\'s settings, so all such material was blocked. Facts, it seems, are not required by those pushing eccentric and damaging narratives. President Trump holds his daily press briefing as US deaths from Covid-19 double in a week.',\n",
       " '\"There are no words that can adequately describe how deeply this crisis is impacting aviation.\" So said the boss of the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Where Alexandre de Juniac could find words, he wasn\\'t mincing them, and he also had numbers. Between April and June, \"some $61bn could disappear from cash reserves. Demand is in free-fall. Worldwide, it\\'s down 70% compared to last year: 90% in Europe. And it could get even worse\". The industry reckons 65 million jobs are linked to aviation: \"Our estimation is that some 25 million people\\'s jobs are at risk until the aviation sector is functioning again,\" he continued, in a briefing on Tuesday.  \"Twenty-five million people is equal to the entire population of Australia.  It is equal to the entire labour force of Italy. The scale of the economic impact is enormous.\" You won\\'t be surprised to learn he was looking for bailout from governments - lots of bailouts from lots of governments: direct financial support, loans, loan guarantees, support for corporate bonds, tax relief, deferred air traffic control costs, at which Eurocontrol helped out on Tuesday. It is estimated that at least 8,500 aircraft are currently parked. Only around quarter of the global capacity is in operation. That\\'s not only a lot of asset value, and leasehold bills, sitting doing nothing. Mechanically, planes don\\'t like being idle either. It\\'s good for them to keep moving. If airlines can get through the cash crisis, the next question is how to get going again. And the IATA boss doesn\\'t want to leave that to chance: \"We do not expect to re-open this same industry we closed a few weeks ago.\" It will require co-ordination with regulators, for licensing and air worthiness certificates. It will also need co-ordination with health authorities around the world, who will want to shut down the risk of re-infection. The authorities have been notable for the failure to co-ordinate so far, and it looks like airlines that have to deal with the consequences of that continuing as travel opens up again. Lufthansa doesn\\'t want to leave things to chance either. The German flag-carrier followed up on Tuesday with an announcement that it has made a bold move to cut capacity permanently. It also believes aviation will not return to the way it was, as little as three months ago. More than 40 of its aircraft, most notably the big 380s and the old, polluting 7474s, are being retired or sold off. Its subsidiaries, Austrian, Swiss and Brussels Airways, are doing likewise. \"It will take several months until the global travel restrictions are completely lifted and years until the worldwide demand for air travel returns to pre-crisis levels,\" is the insight from Frankfurt. It is informed partly by the growing pressure to reduce emissions from aviation, allied to a growing, youth-driven consumer movement away from flying, with \"flight shaming\" of those who do. This closure of the European industry, and hard times for airlines elsewhere, comes after an extensive repatriation effort, pockets of which continue. By the time Easyjet grounded its fleet of 330 planes, at the start of last week, it had flown 650 such flights, for 45,000 people. All the cabin crew are on furlough. The pain for airlines extends to companies that lease planes - more than half of those that would normally be operational. They\\'re being asked for lease holidays. And if airlines start going bust, then the leasing companies will be left with a lot of planes on their hands - surplus planes, if Lufthansa\\'s judgement is correct. One that\\'s at high risk of going bust is Norwegian. The stock market has noted as much, with a steep fall in its share price. It\\'s since had a rescue package from the Oslo government, but there are still big debts weighing on it. Others will fall over, depending how deep their cash reserves are, how much they can tap markets for capital injections, and how much they can get out of governments. Alitalia has been renationalised by the Italian government. Air France is partly owned by the French government. The US budget package to tackle the effects of coronavirus, at two trillion dollars - $2,000,000,000,000 - earmarks $58bn in loans and loan guarantees for American passenger airlines and cargo carriers, including funds for employees\\' wages and benefits, and a waiver for aviation tax for the year. The UK government has been saying it doesn\\'t intend to find a special package in response to the cries for help. However, the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, qualified that, indicating he\\'ll listen to special pleading, but only after airlines have exhausted all the other bits of support that are on offer. Virgin Atlantic says it needs help. EasyJet says, for now, that it can get by using the government\\'s existing emergency funds, such as the Job Retention Scheme to fund workers put on furlough. Loganair, now one of the biggest operators on internal UK flights and important to the Highlands and Islands, has called for help, and it\\'s been given some help with the extension of the Treasury\\'s lending criteria to include companies of its size. British Airways, as part of IAG with Iberia, is in a stronger financial position, but even that could be stretched tight if this goes on, and on. Among those under less financial pressure is Ryanair, with cash in hand and owning most of its aircraft without heavy debts to do so. It\\'s less clear, these days, what a \"flag carrier\" is and how much that matters.  Are Brits all that sentimental about British Airways, 33 years after it was privatised? British and European governments may feel there\\'s pressure to ensure their airlines survive as vital commercial infrastructure, in case they emerge from this in a wasteland of corporate carnage, only to find that foreign airlines, with government support though the crisis, take over European routes. As rules stand, airlines have to be registered in the European Union to be allowed to fly routes within it. The USA has similar rules, to block out foreign ownership of transport entities that are perceived as vital national infrastructure. And don\\'t forget airports are suffering badly through this - all but deserted, still a bit operational, and with high fixed costs. The Scottish government found some of its extra funds to add them to the sectors enjoying a year-long business rates holiday, along with the companies that operate within them. That includes John Menzies. You may remember it as your local newsagent, but that division has been sold, and the Edinburgh-based firm is now a global airport ground handling business.  With few planes flying, it has laid off 17,500 workers. It is making the point to governments that if the sector doesn\\'t get support from them, the baggage handlers simply won\\'t be there when the upturn comes. There would be a lot of empty carousels. The Scottish government has several airports on its books, for which it may have to dig deep. The secure ones are in the Highlands and Islands, from Sumburgh to Campbeltown. The insecure one is Prestwick, for which a preferred buyer - understood to be AGS, owner of Glasgow and Aberdeen - was on a lengthy approach to the landing zone. As its financial plans are out the window, and its other airport, Southampton, has lost almost all its traffic with the demise of Flybe, don\\'t be surprised if it aborts that landing. That would leave Prestwick in limbo, with little to do, and dependent on continued Scottish government subsidy. Aviation is an interesting example of how you can\\'t simply slam the brakes on an entire industry - or much of the world\\'s economy - when it\\'s going at full tilt, without problems and a lot of injured people piling up behind you. But not everyone is a loser from this.  One part of aviation doing very nicely just now is freight. A lot of freight is carried in the belly of passenger aircraft. That includes, for instance, a lot of fresh Scottish salmon. But without that airliner capacity, the cost of getting your produce air freighted on a cargo plane has soared. Per kilo, I\\'m told, air freight is up around ten-fold. Some furloughed airliners are being rapidly adapted to take freight instead of people. But there are also unexpected losers. One victim turns out to be the weather forecast.  With far fewer planes crossing the Atlantic, harvesting meteorological statistics by the tens of thousands each day, the mighty computers that crunch weather patterns have much less data collection as feedstock. So if weather forecasters are going unusually wide of the mark in the next few weeks and months, that may be yet another unexpected consequence of unbelievable times.

       " 'New evidence has emerged of a link between human exploitation of nature and pandemics. Close contact with wild animals through hunting, trade or habitat loss puts the world at increased risk of outbreaks of new diseases, say scientists. Coronavirus is thought to have originated in bats, with other wild animals, possibly pangolins, playing a role in transmission to humans. There are strong indications of a wildlife source and a link to trade. In the latest study, researchers trawled scientific papers for reports of diseases that have crossed from animals to humans, then combined this data with information on extinction risk compiled by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Wild animals at risk of extinction due to human exploitation were found to carry over twice as many viruses that can cause human disease as threatened species listed for other reasons. The same was true for threatened species at risk due to loss of habitat. \"Wildlife also shift their distributions to accommodate anthropogenic activities and modification of the natural landscape. This has hastened disease emergence from wildlife, which put us at risk of pandemics because we are all globally connected through travel and trade.\" Wild animals on the edge of extinction are few in number and generally pose a low risk of passing on infectious diseases, said Dr Johnson, except where human exploitation and habitat loss puts them in close contact with humans. \"Exploitation of wildlife, which has caused once abundant wildlife to decline in numbers, through hunting and trading in wildlife, have endangered species survival and also put humans at risk of emerging infectious disease,\" she said. Scientists have long drawn attention to human diseases that have originated in animals, including Sars, Mers and Ebola.  In the wake of coronavirus, there is growing awareness that human health is linked both with animal health and the health of the planet as a whole. A wide range of organisations are calling for curbs on wild animal trade to reduce risks to human health. Dr Johnson said wild animals sold in busy markets where animals and people mix present an opportunity for diseases to jump between species that would normally never come together in the natural world. \"Disease emergence that occurs anywhere can affect us all and we need to all understand the impact we are having when we interact with wildlife, realise that disease emergence is an environmental issue, and find more sustainable ways to co-exist.\" The research is published in the journal Royal Society Proceedings B.

       " 'From the flamboyant to the ultra-modern and the visionary, these are some of the most stunning dream interiors of the past 100 years. What makes them so iconic? How do you define ‘iconic’ in the world of design? For some time, the word has been blithely bandied about to describe a new building, which, it is hoped, will become a well-known landmark or provide a city with cultural kudos. On closer consideration, the word is slippery, capable of meaning many things. It can suggest a global fame and popularity garnered by a building such as the Eiffel Tower in Paris \\xad\\xad– now emblematic of an entire city. Or it can describe a designer’s quintessential project – one that truly sums up his or her work. A thoughtful evaluation of 20th and 21st-Century domestic interiors currently exerts a huge fascination in the design world \\xad– and prompts questions about what iconic means in this context. A new book, The Iconic Interior, by Dominic Bradbury with photographs by Richard Powers, is a thumping tome that explores the evolution of extraordinary homes around the world, from around 1900 to the present. An updated edition of his 2012 book, it features around 600 images of extraordinary houses. Bradbury is aware of the trite over-use of the word iconic: “I’m always suspicious of those who claim a brand new project is iconic, since only time will tell,” he says. Instead, he believes, a house comes to be seen as iconic organically: “Most architects and designers just set out to do their best rather than aim to create something iconic. For me, an iconic interior has influence well beyond the original ambition of a project and takes on a life as a key reference point in the wider world.” Meanwhile, the exhibition Home Stories: 100 Years, 20 Visionary Interiors, organised by the Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein in Germany, also focuses on the history of homes\\xa0over a similar period. Although currently closed, the museum now plans to extend the show beyond the summer. Its accompanying catalogue features essays by leading design writers, curators and designers who examine the influence of politics, major social changes and technological advances on interiors. “We’ve seen an interest in domestic interior design as a discipline for some time, yet it seems to have lacked a serious discourse until now,” says the exhibition’s curator Jochen Eisenbrand. “It’s mainly dealt with in superficial ways – in glossy magazines, TV shows and social media. We wanted to show important historical examples as an inspiration for a more serious discussion.” The exhibition spotlights diverse interiors by such key figures as Austrian architect Adolf Loos, Danish architect Finn Juhl, Italian-born Brazilian architect Lina Bo Bardi, US interior designer Elsie de Wolfe, artist Andy Warhol and photographer Cecil Beaton. Both book and show feature interiors designed by women who are less well-known than many of their male counterparts. One point raised by the show is the sexist distinction once made between interior decoration, an amateur occupation usually undertaken by ‘housewives’ or women from affluent backgrounds, and architecture, a serious profession practised by men. One example of the former was Edith Wharton, the novelist, whose interiors are featured in both show and book, as are those of Elsie de Wolfe, a former actress turned interior decorator. In 1914, De Wolfe furnished 14 rooms in the Frick Residence in New York, a building in the French Neoclassical style. She was known for her light touch – a preference for uncluttered interiors, sparingly furnished with unimposing French antiques. The exhibition catalogue features an essay by design writer Alice Rawsthorn entitled Interior Design – A Matter of Gender? In it, she points out how difficult it was for women in the 19th Century to work in interior design, with the notable exception of well-connected British cousins Rhoda and Agnes Garrett. Agnes’s sisters Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, Britain’s first woman doctor, and Millicent Garrett Fawcett, the women’s suffrage campaigner, commissioned them to design the interiors of their homes. “The Garretts swiftly became known for a subtly elegant, utilitarian and comfortable style of interiors that contrasted sharply with the typically fussy, gaudy British homes of the era,” writes Rawsthorn, author of the book Design as an Attitude. The show also takes in social housing. In 1926, German architect and city-planner Ernst May began to oversee Frankfurt’s highly acclaimed affordable public housing project, New Frankfurt, built in response to a housing shortage and completed in 1930. Its emphasis on efficient use of space, in particular in kitchens, was inspired by US home economist Christine Frederick, an advocate of Taylorism applied to interior design. Austrian architect Margarete Schütte-Lihotsky\\xa0made a significant contribution to the project, creating the prototype for a built-in kitchen – a \\xa0template for the modern, streamlined, fitted kitchen. The dimensions and layout of this compact, labour-saving, low-cost design were based on Taylorist principles and research regarding the number of footsteps necessary to perform various tasks. Around 10,000 Frankfurt kitchens, as they are known, were installed in working-class apartments in the city in the late 1920s. In contrast to the early 20th-Century movement for affordable, practical homes, but running parallel to it was a trend for individualistic abodes with flamboyant, fantastical decors. “Cecil Beaton’s house Ashcombe, an extremely individual home unrestrained by tradition and notions of good taste, was almost a stage set,” says Eisenbrand. Beaton rented this Georgian manor house in Wiltshire in the English countryside from 1930 to 1945, inviting stage designer Oliver Messel to paint murals there, and entertaining everyone from actress Tallulah Bankhead to artist Salvador Dalí in his home. Similarly outlandish was Dawnridge in Los Angeles, co-created by Tony Duquette, a costume and set designer for Hollywood movies, and architect Casper Ehmcke in 1949. Duquette stuffed it with seashell-encrusted screens, chandeliers dripping with glass lilies, multiple mirrors to create the illusion of more space, elaborate architectural maquettes, and sofas covered in orange or shocking pink fabrics. The show also highlights how the rebellious spirit and increasingly relaxed lifestyles of the 1960s resulted in more informal interiors. Paradoxically, an iconoclastic interior can become regarded, over time, as iconic. Take Andy Warhol’s 1960s Silver Factory in New York – a trailblazer for loft-living, and a major inspiration behind the industrial aesthetic found in countless interiors ever since. Eisenbrand sees the Silver Factory, whose walls were spray-painted silver, and lined with tin foil by photographer Billy Name, as influential on several levels: “It’s arguably the most famous example of loft-living because it has been photographed and filmed so much. It’s also a good example of the artist’s studio as nexus for living and working, and of communal living in the 1960s. It reflects urban development at the time: it typifies the rise of loft-living in Manhattan, triggered by industry moving out of inner-city areas. “Meanwhile, influential French architect Claude Parent, in collaboration with cultural theorist Paul Virilio, challenged the Modernist convention of the cube-like interior when he designed his anti-rationalist apartment in Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris from 1973 to 1974. Parent considered vertical planes pedestrian, ousting them in favour of eccentric sloping floors, intended as multifunctional surfaces adaptable as seating, workspaces\\xa0and daybeds. Admirers of his so-called ‘oblique architecture’ have included architects Frank Gehry and Zaha Hadid. In some cases, homes have become iconic because architects assiduously publicised their projects, or because widespread media coverage brought them recognition. “Lina Bo Bardi published her Casa de Vidro project in the magazine Habitat that she published,” says Einsenbrand. “Beaton’s place Ashcombe was featured in Vogue and Sketch magazines and in the book he wrote about it. Another iconic home, architects Alison and Peter Smithson’s House of the Future of 1956, was conceived for The Daily Mail Ideal Home Exhibition which guaranteed media exposure in the paper and in TV documentaries.” Many homes in the book The Iconic Interior were created by high-profile architects for themselves or for adventurous clients. Others were inhabited by creatives, including artists and designers, who treated them as spaces where they gave free rein to their taste. At Charleston, the East Sussex farmhouse that Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell rented from 1916, busily hand-painted walls testify to the equal importance Bloomsbury Group artists gave to fine art and the decorative arts. One of the earliest homes featured in the book is Villa Esche in Germany, designed in 1903 by Belgian artist and architect Henry van de Velde for Herbert Esche, a businessman and patron of the arts. The 32-room villa, with all furniture designed by Van de Velde, was in the forward-looking Art Nouveau style, which represented a major watershed in interiors by rejecting all past architectural styles, and often espousing asymmetric forms inspired by nature. An interior can become iconic because it was radically unorthodox and ahead of its time, as Bradley points out: “Adolf Loos is a famous example of someone who openly challenged convention”. Loos was an early proponent of Modernism and this book includes his sparsely furnished Steiner House in Vienna, designed in 1910. That year, Loos delivered his lecture, Ornament and Crime, which lambasted the domestic clutter of the Victorian era. “The evolution of culture marches with the elimination of ornament from useful objects,” he proclaimed. Even so, early 20th-Century Art Deco flouted doctrinaire functionalism. A striking 1920s example is couturière Jeanne Lanvin’s opulent Paris apartment, designed by Armand-Albert Rateau. Its bedroom, whose walls were lined with silk in lapis-lazuli blue, was later reassembled and is exhibited at Paris’s Musée des Arts Décoratifs. Although mainly known as an Art Deco designer, Rateau’s approach was eclectic, drawing inspiration, too, from Neoclassicism and Japanese decorative arts. By the 1930s, a softer, more organic take on Modernism was emerging, exemplified by Soviet émigré architect Berthold Lubetkin’s penthouse in his building Highpoint II in Highgate, London. Here natural materials abounded, including rough-cut lengths of timber lining the walls and brown tiled floors. Deep in woodland in the River Hudson Valley in New York State, designer Russell Wright made even more of a virtue of natural materials in his bid to unite nature and architecture with his proto-eco house Dragon Rock, built into a hillside in 1961. “The house should complement this tiny part of the world. We should preserve its beauty,” noted Wright. Exposed, rugged granite and cedar trees form part of the house’s fabric, the fireplace was constructed from boulders, while his green-roofed studio\\xa0stood a short distance away, its desk overlooking the woods. Other celebrated modernist projects include the expansive Strick House in Santa Monica, California designed by Oscar Niemeyer in 1964, a largely glass-fronted house whose high-ceilinged living room overlooks a swimming pool and garden. The book also features the Niemeyer-inspired Milan House in São Paulo, designed by Marcos Acayaba in 1975, which comprises a curved concrete roof containing three interconnected levels that visually connect with tropical gardens surrounding the building. By the 1960s and 1970s, US architects – and husband and wife – Roberto Venturi and Denise Scott Brown were radically questioning Modernism and ushering in Postmodernism. They celebrated and rehabilitated architectural elements long banished by Modernism, such as historicism and ornamentation. In Venturi’s 1966 book, Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture, he coined his witty riposte to modernist architect Mies van der Rohe’s earnest dictum “Less is more” \\xad– \\xa0“Less is a bore”. \\xa0In the 1972 tome, Learning from Las Vegas, which he co-wrote with Scott Brown and Steve Izenour, he recognised a vitality in the brash, pastiche architecture of Las Vegas that clean-lined, rationalist modernist architecture lacked. The couple moved into their Art Nouveau-style home, Venturi House, in Philadelphia, furnishing its dining room with chairs painted a blackcurrant-fool shade and inscribing its walls with the names of their illustrious but ill-assorted heroes, from Neoclassical architect John Soane to arch-modernist Le Corbusier. The living room was gleefully eclectic, kitsch and ironic, combining walls stencilled with floral motifs, a pop parody of a Vermeer painting, Italian designer Gae Aulenti’s 1966 Pipistrello lamp with an Art Nouveau-style shade and a flamingo-pink neon strip light. A later example featured in the book is the idiosyncratic London apartment of industrial designer Marc Newson, co-created with architects Squire & Partners in 2010. It’s inspired by the Swiss chalet in Alfred Hitchcock ‘s 1959 movie North by Northwest, and one wall in its theatrical living room is studded with stones sourced from a river in Nova Scotia. Naturally, books such as The Iconic Interior help to confer iconic status on homes by featuring them. Even looking at images of homes not open to the public raises awareness of them and gives them an appealing mystique. “My book mixes homes that can be visited with others that remain private,” says Bradbury. “The latter have to work harder to gain recognition. But some achieve an almost mythical status.” The Iconic Interior\\xa0by Dominic Bradbury is published by Thames & Hudson.

       " 'Okonomiyaki\\'s popularity first began to soar in the A-bomb aftermath, when food was scarce and people had to feed their families with whatever they had at hand. One chilly spring afternoon around a decade ago, my wife Angeles and I were walking along Hiroshima’s Tenma River, looking for a place to eat. Famished and frozen after a day’s sightseeing, we fantasized about something hot, tasty and filling that wouldn’t bankrupt us. We’d only been in Japan a few days, so eating out was still a daily trip down a rabbit hole into a culinary wonderland. We spotted a dark-blue noren curtain hanging outside a small shop, a sign that it was open, and ducked in. Inside the tiny space were just half a dozen little tables and four empty barstools. The owner, a large cheery-faced woman, cried “irashaimasen” (welcome) and beckoned us to sit at the “bar” – a large rectangular hotplate. Our Japanese was still rudimentary, so we just said “hai” (yes) and “onegaishimasu” (please, or thank you) to everything she said, and hoped for the best. She doled out two ladlefuls of batter onto the hotplate, and spread them out into two big circles, side by side. She then put a Fuji-sized mountain of cabbage on top, followed by a good handful of bean sprouts and some thin rashers of pork. Next, while the vegetables steamed away, she placed two great tangles of ramen noodles alongside. After a few minutes, she deftly flipped the pancakes over, placing each one on top of a pile of noodles. It was culinary performance art; an edible sculpture taking shape before our eyes. It looked and smelled delicious. But she hadn’t finished yet. Cracking two eggs onto the grill, she spread each one out into a circle the same size as the pancake. Finally, she placed the pancake on top of the egg, then decorated the entire mound with a generous sprinkling of chopped green onions, dried bonito flakes and nori seaweed. Handing us a couple of bottles of sauce – one mayonnaise and the other a heavenly smelling brown sauce – she gestured us to dig in with a hearty “itadakimasu!” (bon appetit). We drizzled the sauces on top, and ate directly off the hotplate, using a metal spatula. And, just as we’d fantasized, it was hot, delicious, filling and cheap. That was our first experience of Hiroshima’s legendary okonomiyaki, an experience that we repeated many times over the following years as Hiroshima became our permanent home. It’s been called “the Japanese pizza” or “the Japanese pancake”, but such comparisons fail to conjure the wonder of the okonomiyaki experience. London has jellied eels. Valencia has paella. New Orleans has gumbo. And Hiroshima has okonomiyaki – a signature dish that defines the identity of the city. Okonomiyaki is popular all over Japan, particularly in the Kansai region, which includes Osaka, Kyoto and Kobe, and in Hiroshima, some 300km down the Inland Sea coast from Osaka. But the Hiroshima region holds a distinctive claim to fame: it has more okonomiyaki restaurants per capita than any other region in the country; and there are more than 2,000 of them in Hiroshima city alone. Okonomimura (literally Okonomi Village), in the heart of downtown Hiroshima, is a four-floor labyrinth of more than 25 okonomiyaki restaurants, each with its own variations. These variations are key to the dish’s popularity. Don’t like pork? Then try it with locally caught oysters. Prefer a vegetarian option? Order one with soy meat. Over on Miyajima Island, just a 10-minute ferry ride across Hiroshima Bay, some places, like the seafront Yosakoi restaurant, serve anagoyaki: okonomiyaki with slices of anago (conger eel), an island specialty. This “whatever you like” approach also makes okonomiyaki an ideal dish to prepare at home, using whatever you have handy or leftovers from your fridge. One evening when a friend invited us to her house for an okonomiyaki dinner, her father brought over two freshly caught squid, so they became the main ingredient. This media cannot be played on your device. A friendly rivalry exists between Kansai and Hiroshima as to which area makes the best okonomiyaki. Both styles taste fabulous. The main difference is that the Kansai style mixes all the ingredients together, while Hiroshima prefers a layered style. Moreover, the Kansai version doesn’t use noodles. That’s why we’ve heard more than one Hiroshima resident comment that the Kansai version “is just a snack”. Regional preferences apart, Hiroshima’s citizens have another reason to be proud of their local dish: it’s the food that fuelled the city’s post-A-bomb renaissance. An early prototype of Hiroshima’s okonomiyaki first appeared in the pre-World War Two period. Known as “issen yōshoku” (literally: “one-coin Western food”, or “Western food for a penny”), it was simply a thin pancake topped with green onions and dried fish flakes or shrimp, but it proved particularly popular among children. On 6 August 1945, an atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, instantly turning the city into a charred wasteland. In the aftermath of this horror, the survivors – facing acute food shortages – had to make do with whatever food they could find. Some inventive souls salvaged iron plates from the rubble and used them as makeshift hotplates on which to cook issen yōshoku, their favourite pre-war treat, using flour and whatever else they could get their hands on. As the city’s reconstruction gathered momentum, food stalls and other cheap eateries sprang up around town, selling issen yoshoku. Many of these street stalls were concentrated in the downtown Shintenchi area, where the Okonomimura complex now stands. They began adding whatever ingredients were available – such as cabbage, eggs, ramen or soba noodles and locally caught seafood – to make issen yoshoku a more substantial dish that could sustain the local people as they rebuilt their lives, and their city. This new pick-and-mix approach to the ingredients is how the dish earned its more appropriate name: okonomiyaki, which means “whatever you like, grilled”. By the late 1950s, it had become popular among all social classes and age groups, a cherished symbol of the local people’s resilience and vitality. According to Shizuka Kobara, public relations officer at Otafuku, the leading Hiroshima-based manufacturer of that sweet-smelling okonomiyaki sauce, “Hiroshima developed side-by-side with okonomiyaki; it took root in the citizens and became their favourite food since then. It’s literally soul food for Hiroshima people.” If you’ve ever been to Hiroshima, you’ll have smelled okonomiyaki, even if you didn’t try it. You can scarcely walk more than a block without being greeted by the warm, welcoming aroma pouring out of doorways and windows, permeating the air with its happy sweetness. Just a whiff is enough to banish the blues. Our friend Yasuko even takes bottles of okonomiyaki sauce – which is a little like Worcestershire sauce, but sweeter and less salty – with her when she travels, to stave off homesickness. So, what goes into this magical potion? According to Kobara, “many fruits and vegetables, including tomato, dates, onions and apples, with more than 20 kinds of spices and peppers.” Nowadays, with so many restaurants competing for trade, the okonomiyaki scene in Hiroshima is constantly evolving as owners come up with new ways to attract customers and make okonomiyaki more accessible to foreign visitors. In 2008, Otafuku opened the Wood Egg Okonomiyaki Museum where visitors can tour their factory and museum, and learn to cook okonomiyaki. They followed up in 2018 with the Okosta Okonomi Experience cooking studio next to Hiroshima station. With the slogan “Borderless Happiness”, Okosta welcomes people of all nationalities and cultures who want to learn to make their own okonomiyaki. Vegetarian and halal versions are among the options. In its first year, 200,000 people visited the studio, 20% of whom were from overseas. Otafuku’s aim is to “contribute to a joyous society with health, wellness and happiness through food,” Kobara said. Our favourite okonomiyaki spot is the Tokugawa restaurant in Hiroshima’s Hesaka district. It’s worth visiting for the building alone – an historical wooden house with a sweeping black-tiled roof, dating back more than 140 years to the early Meiji Era (1868-1912). As you step past the small garden and slide back the door, you find yourself in a shadowy hall of exposed rafters and tatami-floored booths. It’s like you’ve stepped into a past century. The waiter brings the ingredients, switches on the hotplate, which is also your table, and then leaves you to prepare your own okonomiyaki. If you get confused, just press the button and the ever-patient staff will come to your rescue. If you don’t fancy eating directly from the hotplate with the spatula, ask for chopsticks and a plate, or even a knife and fork. Whichever you choose, cooking has never been such a fun challenge. It’s also a highly sociable way to eat, “gathered around the hotplate chatting happily as you cook and eat,” as Kobara put it. With okonomiyaki restaurants springing up everywhere from Barcelona to Brisbane, Hiroshima’s iconic dish looks set to join sushi, tofu and ramen as another beloved Japanese culinary export. So, when you come to Hiroshima, be sure to try a real okonomiyaki – with whatever ingredients you fancy – and treat your heart to some Hiroshima-style happiness.

       " 'Okonomiyaki\\'s popularity first began to soar in the A-bomb aftermath, when food was scarce and people had to feed their families with whatever they had at hand. One chilly spring afternoon around a decade ago, my wife Angeles and I were walking along Hiroshima’s Tenma River, looking for a place to eat. Famished and frozen after a day’s sightseeing, we fantasized about something hot, tasty and filling that wouldn’t bankrupt us. We’d only been in Japan a few days, so eating out was still a daily trip down a rabbit hole into a culinary wonderland. We spotted a dark-blue noren curtain hanging outside a small shop, a sign that it was open, and ducked in. Inside the tiny space were just half a dozen little tables and four empty barstools. The owner, a large cheery-faced woman, cried “irashaimasen” (welcome) and beckoned us to sit at the “bar” – a large rectangular hotplate. Our Japanese was still rudimentary, so we just said “hai” (yes) and “onegaishimasu” (please, or thank you) to everything she said, and hoped for the best. She doled out two ladlefuls of batter onto the hotplate, and spread them out into two big circles, side by side. She then put a Fuji-sized mountain of cabbage on top, followed by a good handful of bean sprouts and some thin rashers of pork. Next, while the vegetables steamed away, she placed two great tangles of ramen noodles alongside. After a few minutes, she deftly flipped the pancakes over, placing each one on top of a pile of noodles. It was culinary performance art; an edible sculpture taking shape before our eyes. It looked and smelled delicious. But she hadn’t finished yet. Cracking two eggs onto the grill, she spread each one out into a circle the same size as the pancake. Finally, she placed the pancake on top of the egg, then decorated the entire mound with a generous sprinkling of chopped green onions, dried bonito flakes and nori seaweed. Handing us a couple of bottles of sauce – one mayonnaise and the other a heavenly smelling brown sauce – she gestured us to dig in with a hearty “itadakimasu!” (bon appetit). We drizzled the sauces on top, and ate directly off the hotplate, using a metal spatula. And, just as we’d fantasized, it was hot, delicious, filling and cheap.
